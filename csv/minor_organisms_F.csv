1244,"High level of polarized engraftment of porcine intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids in decellularized liver scaffolds.; bioengineering and cell polarity and livers and organoids and swine and tissue scaffolding; In Europe alone, each year 5500 people require a life-saving liver transplantation, but 18% die before receiving one due to the shortage of donor organs. Whole organ engineering, utilizing decellularized liver scaffolds repopulated with autologous cells, is an attractive alternative to increase the pool of available organs for transplantation. The development of this technology is hampered by a lack of a suitable large-animal model representative of the human physiology and a reliable and continuous cell source. We have generated porcine intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids from adult stem cells and demonstrate that these cultures remained stable over multiple passages whilst retaining the ability to differentiate into hepatocyte- and cholangiocyte-like cells. Recellularization onto porcine scaffolds was efficient and the organoids homogeneously differentiated, even showing polarization. Our porcine intrahepatic cholangiocyte system, combined with porcine liver scaffold paves the way for developing whole liver engineering in a relevant large-animal model.","10.1111/jcmm.17510",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1255,"MNK2 deficiency potentiates -cell regeneration via translational regulation.; NA; Regenerating pancreatic -cells is a potential curative approach for diabetes. We previously identified the small molecule CID661578 as a potent inducer of -cell regeneration, but its target and mechanism of action have remained unknown. We now screened 257 million yeast clones and determined that CID661578 targets MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MNK2), an interaction we genetically validated in vivo. CID661578 increased -cell neogenesis from ductal cells in zebrafish, neonatal pig islet aggregates and human pancreatic ductal organoids. Mechanistically, we found that CID661578 boosts protein synthesis and regeneration by blocking MNK2 from binding eIF4G in the translation initiation complex at the mRNA cap. Unexpectedly, this blocking activity augmented eIF4E phosphorylation depending on MNK1 and bolstered the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, which is necessary for both hypertranslation and -cell regeneration. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a targetable role of MNK2-controlled translation in -cell regeneration, a role that warrants further investigation in diabetes.","10.1038/s41589-022-01047-x",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1262,"Patch grafting of organoids of stem/progenitors into solid organs can correct genetic-based disease states.; Biliary tree and Cell therapies and Diabetes and Liver and Organoids and Pancreas and Patch grafting and Stem/progenitors and Tyrosinemia; Patch grafting, a novel strategy for transplantation of stem/progenitor organoids into porcine livers, has been found successful also for organoid transplantation into other normal or diseased solid organs in pigs and mice. Each organoid contained 100 cells comprised of biliary tree stem cells (BTSCs), co-hepato/pancreatic stem/progenitors, and partnered with early lineage stage mesenchymal cells (ELSMCs), angioblasts and precursors to endothelia and stellate cells. Patch grafting enabled transplantation into livers or pancreases of 10(8th) (pigs) or 10(6th-7th) (mice) organoids/patch. Graft conditions fostered expression of multiple matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially secretory isoforms, resulting in transient loss of the organ's matrix-dictated histological features, including organ capsules, and correlated with rapid integration within a week of organoids throughout the organs and without emboli or ectopic cell distribution. Secondarily, within another week, there was clearance of graft biomaterials, followed by muted expression of MMPs, restoration of matrix-dictated histology, and maturation of donor cells to functional adult fates. The ability of patch grafts of organoids to rescue hosts from genetic-based disease states was demonstrated with grafts of BTSC/ELSMC organoids on livers, able to rescue NRG/FAH-KO mice from type I tyrosinemia, a disease caused by absence of fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase. With the same grafts, if on pancreas, they were able to rescue NRG/Akita mice from type I diabetes, caused by a mutation in the insulin 2 gene. The potential of patch grafting for cell therapies for solid organs now requires translational studies to enable its adaptation and uses for clinical programs.","10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121647",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1272,"Establishment of a direct 2.5D organoid culture model using companion animal cancer tissues.; 2.5D and 3D and Cats and Culture model and Dogs and Organoids and Patient-derived and Primary; Like humans, cancer affects companion animals with similar genetic risks and incident rates. To improve treatment strategies for pet cancers, new research models are necessary. Patient-derived 3D organoid culture models are valuable and ensure the development of new effective therapies. In the previous study, we established a 3D organoid-derived 2.5D organoid culture model that recapitulated some characteristics of their parental 3D organoids. In the present study, we aimed to generate a 2.5D organoid culture model directly from cancer-diseased dogs and cats using special 2.5D media. The primary cultured cells in 2.5D media (direct 2.5D organoids) showed better attachment, growth, marker expression, and faster proliferation speed than those cultured in normal Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium media. The direct 2.5D organoids showed expression of each specific marker to their original cancer tissues and exhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, the direct 2.5D organoids exhibited concentration-dependent responses to anti-cancer drugs, and different sensitivity profiles were shown among the strains. Our data suggest that the direct 2.5D organoid culture model might become a useful tool beyond 2D cell lines to study cancer biology in companion animals and could provide new platforms for screening the anti-cancer drugs.","10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113597",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1275,"Differential Transcriptomic Profiles Following Stimulation with Lipopolysaccharide in Intestinal Organoids from Dogs with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Intestinal Mast Cell Tumor.; IBD and LPS and canine and colonoids and enteroids and mast cell tumor and microarray; Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with chronic intestinal inflammation and promotes intestinal cancer progression in the gut. While the interplay between LPS and intestinal immune cells has been well-characterized, little is known about LPS and the intestinal epithelium interactions. In this study, we explored the differential effects of LPS on proliferation and the transcriptome in 3D enteroids/colonoids obtained from dogs with naturally occurring gastrointestinal (GI) diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intestinal mast cell tumor. The study objective was to analyze the LPS-induced modulation of signaling pathways involving the intestinal epithelia and contributing to colorectal cancer development in the context of an inflammatory (IBD) or a tumor microenvironment. While LPS incubation resulted in a pro-cancer gene expression pattern and stimulated proliferation of IBD enteroids and colonoids, downregulation of several cancer-associated genes such as Gpatch4, SLC7A1, ATP13A2, and TEX45 was also observed in tumor enteroids. Genes participating in porphyrin metabolism (CP), nucleocytoplasmic transport (EEF1A1), arachidonic acid, and glutathione metabolism (GPX1) exhibited a similar pattern of altered expression between IBD enteroids and IBD colonoids following LPS stimulation. In contrast, genes involved in anion transport, transcription and translation, apoptotic processes, and regulation of adaptive immune responses showed the opposite expression patterns between IBD enteroids and colonoids following LPS treatment. In brief, the crosstalk between LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway and several metabolic pathways such as primary bile acid biosynthesis and secretion, peroxisome, renin-angiotensin system, glutathione metabolism, and arachidonic acid pathways may be important in driving chronic intestinal inflammation and intestinal carcinogenesis.","10.3390/cancers14143525",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1288,"Recombinant Porcine R-Spondin 1 Facilitates Intestinal Stem Cell Expansion along the Crypt-Villus Axis through Potentiating Wnt/-Catenin Signaling in Homeostasis and Deoxynivalenol Injury.; Wnt/-catenin signaling and deoxynivalenol and injury-repair response and intestinal stem cell and recombinant porcine R-spondin 1; R-spondin 1 (RSPO1) is a ligand for the intestinal stem cell (ISC) marker Lgr5 in the crypt, which functions to amplify canonical Wnt signaling to stimulate the division of ISCs. Despite the crucial role of recombinant human RSPO1 (rhRSPO1) in homeostasis and regeneration, little is known about RSPO1 among different species. Here, we cloned the porcine RSPO1 (pRSPO1) gene and obtained rpRSPO1 protein through the expression system of the recombinant Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) chemical competent cells. Using the in vitro IPEC-J2 model that combines cell proliferation evaluation approaches, we identified the rpRSPO1 activity in stimulating jejunal epithelial cells. And upon deoxynivalenol challenge in mice, we found that rpRSPO1 ameliorated their growth retardation and jejunal epithelial integrity. Importantly, the ISCs in the jejunum had greater proliferation and differentiation potential that was accompanied by Wnt/-catenin pathway activation after rpRSPO1 modulation. Subsequently, the jejunal organoids expanded from these ISCs ex vivo presented robust growth advantages. And the rpRSPO1 was able to guide Wnt/-catenin activity to increase ISC activity. Our work systematically demonstrates that rpRSPO1 facilitates ISC expansion by potentiating Wnt/-catenin signaling during homeostasis and responding to deoxynivalenol perturbations.","10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02013",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1325,"Roles of WNT6 in Sheep Endometrial Epithelial Cell Cycle Progression and Uterine Glands Organogenesis.; Hu sheep and WNT6 and cell cycle and endometrial epithelial cell and organoid; The uterus, as part of the female reproductive tract, is essential for embryo survival and in the maintenance of multiple pregnancies in domestic animals. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of WNT6 on Hu sheep endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and uterine glands (UGs) in Hu sheep, with high prolificacy rates. In the present study, Hu sheep with different fecundity, over three consecutive pregnancies, were divided into two groups: high prolificacy rate group (HP, litter size = 3) and low prolificacy rate group (LP, litter size = 1). A comparative analysis of the endometrial morphology was performed by immunofluorescence. RNA-seq was used to analyze the gene's expression in endometrium of HP and LP Hu sheep, providing a candidate gene, which was investigated in EECs and organoid culture. Firstly, higher density of UGs was found in the HP Hu sheep groups (p < 0.05). The RNA-seq data revealed the importance of the WNT signaling pathway and WNT6 gene in Hu sheep endometrium. Functionally, WNT6 could promote the cell cycle progression of EECs via WNT/-catenin signal and enhance UGs organogenesis. Taken together, WNT6 is a crucial regulator for sheep endometrial development; this finding may offer a new insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism of sheep prolificacy.","10.3390/vetsci8120316",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1338,"Long-Term Expanding Porcine Airway Organoids Provide Insights into the Pathogenesis and Innate Immunity of Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus Infection.; PRCoV and PRRs and TGEV and airway organoids and coronavirus and interferons; Respiratory coronaviruses cause serious health threats to humans and animals. Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), a natural transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) mutant with partial spike deletion, causes mild respiratory disease and is an interesting animal respiratory coronavirus model for human respiratory coronaviruses. However, the absence of robust ex vivo models of porcine airway epithelium hinders an understanding of the pathogenesis of PRCoV infection. Here, we generated long-term porcine airway organoids (AOs) derived from basal epithelial cells, which recapitulate the in vivo airway complicated epithelial cellularity. Both 3D and 2D AOs are permissive for PRCoV infection. Unlike TGEV, which established successful infection in both AOs and intestinal organoids, PRCoV was strongly amplified only in AOs, not intestinal organoids. Furthermore, PRCoV infection in AOs mounted vigorous early type I and III interferon (IFN) responses and upregulated the expression of overzealous inflammatory genes, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these data demonstrate that stem-derived porcine AOs can serve as a promising disease model for PRCoV infection and provide a valuable tool to study porcine respiratory infection. IMPORTANCE Porcine respiratory CoV (PRCoV), a natural mutant of TGEV, shows striking pathogenetic similarities to human respiratory CoV infection and provides an interesting animal model for human respiratory CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2. The lack of an in vitro model recapitulating the complicated cellularity and structure of the porcine respiratory tract is a major roadblock for the study of PRCoV infection. Here, we developed long-term 3D airway organoids (AOs) and further established 2D AO monolayer cultures. The resultant 3D and 2D AOs are permissive for PRCoV infection. Notably, PRCoV mediated pronounced IFN and inflammatory responses in AOs, which recapitulated the inflammatory responses associated with PRCoV in vivo infection. Therefore, porcine AOs can be utilized to characterize the pathogenesis of PRCoV and, more broadly, can serve as a universal platform for porcine respiratory infection.","10.1128/jvi.00738-22",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1339,"Using Species a Rotavirus Reverse Genetics to Engineer Chimeric Viruses Expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Epitopes.; NSP3 and VP4 and reverse genetics and rotavirus; Species A rotavirus (RVA) vaccines based on live attenuated viruses are used worldwide in humans. The recent establishment of a reverse genetics system for rotoviruses (RVs) has opened the possibility of engineering chimeric viruses expressing heterologous peptides from other viral or microbial species in order to develop polyvalent vaccines. We tested the feasibility of this concept by two approaches. First, we inserted short SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides into the hypervariable region of the simian RV SA11 strain viral protein (VP) 4. Second, we fused the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or the shorter receptor binding motif (RBM) nested within the RBD, to the C terminus of nonstructural protein (NSP) 3 of the bovine RV RF strain, with or without an intervening Thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A) peptide. Mutating the hypervariable region of SA11 VP4 impeded viral replication, and for these mutants, no cross-reactivity with spike antibodies was detected. To rescue NSP3 mutants, we established a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for the bovine RV RF strain. Except for the RBD mutant that demonstrated a rescue defect, all NSP3 mutants delivered endpoint infectivity titers and exhibited replication kinetics comparable to that of the wild-type virus. In ELISAs, cell lysates of an NSP3 mutant expressing the RBD peptide showed cross-reactivity with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody. 3D bovine gut enteroids were susceptible to infection by all NSP3 mutants, but cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody was only detected for the RBM mutant. The tolerance of large SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertions at the C terminus of NSP3 in the presence of T2A element highlights the potential of this approach for the development of vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously. IMPORTANCE We explored the use of rotaviruses (RVs) to express heterologous peptides, using SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Small SARS-CoV-2 peptide insertions (<34 amino acids) into the hypervariable region of the viral protein 4 (VP4) of RV SA11 strain resulted in reduced viral titer and replication, demonstrating a limited tolerance for peptide insertions at this site. To test the RV RF strain for its tolerance for peptide insertions, we constructed a reverse genetics system. NSP3 was C-terminally tagged with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides of up to 193 amino acids in length. With a T2A-separated 193 amino acid tag on NSP3, there was no significant effect on the viral rescue efficiency, endpoint titer, and replication kinetics. Tagged NSP3 elicited cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in ELISA. We highlight the potential for development of RV vaccine vectors targeting multiple enteric pathogens simultaneously.","10.1128/jvi.00488-22",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1357,"Transcriptome analysis revealed inhibition of lipid metabolism in 2-D porcine enteroids by infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.; Lipid metabolism and Palmitic acid and Porcine enteroids and Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and RNA-seq; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a swine enterovirus that causes huge economic losses to the swine industry. It is of great interest to understand the gene expression patterns of host responses to PEDV infection and the mechanistic insights. Here, we report the differences of gene expression profiles by RNA-seq in the porcine small intestinal 2-D enteroids cells infected with low-passage (16 passages, P16) and high-passage (120 passages, P120) PEDV strains for 12, 24 and 36 h. Of the 57 genes differentially expressed in P16 PEDV infected enteroids, 49 were upregulated and 7 downregulated at all time points. There were 247 genes with different patterns of expression in the enteroids infected with P120 PEDV: upregulation seen with 105 genes and downregulation with the remaining majority at all time points. Infection of both P16 and P120 PEDV strains led to significant upregulation of ISGs, such as ISG15, MX1 and RSAD2. In particular, P120 PEDV infection inhibited transcription of genes related to lipid metabolism, including those involved in lipid decomposition, absorption, bile secretion and cholesterol metabolism. Treatment of the infected enteroids with palmitic acid resulted in marked reduction of replication of both P16 and P120 PEDV strains. These results indicate that PEDV might manipulate lipid metabolism of the host to benefit its replication. Further research is warranted to study the mechanisms how palmitic acid inhibits PEDV replication.","10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.109525",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1383,"The Development of 3D Bovine Intestinal Organoid Derived Models to Investigate Mycobacterium Avium ssp Paratuberculosis Pathogenesis; 2D cell culture;  3D cell model;  cattle;  in vitro model;  Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (MAP);  organoid; Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiological agent of Johne's Disease, a chronic enteritis of ruminants prevalent across the world. It is estimated that approximately 50% of UK dairy herds are infected with MAP, but this is likely an underestimate of the true prevalence. Infection can result in reduced milk yield, infertility and premature culling of the animal, leading to significant losses to the farming economy and negatively affecting animal welfare. Understanding the initial interaction between MAP and the host is critical to develop improved diagnostic tools and novel vaccines. Here we describe the characterisation of three different multicellular in vitro models derived from bovine intestinal tissue, and their use for the study of cellular interactions with MAP. In addition to the previously described basal-out 3D bovine enteroids, we have established viable 2D monolayers and 3D apical-out organoids. The apical-out enteroids differ from previously described bovine enteroids as the apical surface is exposed on the exterior surface of the 3D structure, enabling study of host-pathogen interactions at the epithelial surface without the need for microinjection. We have characterised the cell types present in each model system using RT-qPCR to detect predicted cell type-specific gene expression, and confocal microscopy for cell type-specific protein expression. Each model contained the cells present in the original bovine intestinal tissue, confirming they were representative of the bovine gut. Exposure of the three model systems to the K10 reference strain of MAP K10, and a recent Scottish isolate referred to as C49, led to the observation of intracellular bacteria by confocal microscopy. Enumeration of the bacteria by quantification of genome copy number, indicated that K10 was less invasive than C49 at early time points in infection in all model systems. This study shows that bovine enteroid-based models are permissive to infection with MAP and that these models may be useful in investigating early stages of MAP pathogenesis in a physiologically relevant in vitro system, whilst reducing the use of animals in scientific research.

1386,"Establishment of an experimental model of normal dog bladder organoid using a three-dimensional culture method.; Bladder cancer and Dog and EMT and MDM2 and MIBC and Normal bladder and Organoids and Twist1; Dog bladder cancer (BC) is mostly muscle-invasive (MI) with poor prognosis, and its pathogenesis is close to human MIBC. Three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture ensures novel knowledge on cancer diseases including BC. Recently, we have established dog BC organoids (BCO) using their urine samples. BCO recapitulated the epithelial structures, characteristics, and drug sensitivity of BC-diseased dogs. However, organoids from dog normal bladder epithelium are not established yet. Therefore, the present study aimed to establish dog normal bladder organoids (NBO) for further understanding the pathogenesis of dog BC and human MIBC. The established NBO underwent various analyzes including cell marker expressions, histopathological structures, cancer-related gene expression patterns, and drug sensitivity. NBO could be produced non-invasively with a continuous culturing and recapitulated the structures and characteristics of the dog's normal bladder mucosal tissues. Different drug sensitivities were observed in each NBO. The analysis of RNA sequencing revealed that several novel genes were changed in NBO compared with BCO. NBO showed a higher expression of p53 and E-cadherin, but a lower expression of MDM2 and Twist1 compared with BCO. These results suggest that NBO could be a promising experimental 3D model for studying the developmental mechanisms of dog BC and human MIBC.","10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113105",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1430,"Endothelin-1 Depletion of Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein Modulates Pulmonary Artery Superoxide and Iron Metabolism-associated Mitochondrial Heme Biosynthesis.; guanylate cyclase and nitric oxide and pulmonary hypertension and transferrin receptor-1; This study examines if heme biosynthesis associated iron metabolism is regulated in pulmonary arteries by endothelin-1 (ET1) potentially through modulating Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) availability. Our studies in organoid cultured endothelium-rubbed bovine pulmonary arteries (BPA) observed COMP depletion by siRNA or hypoxia increases NOX2 and superoxide, and depletes mitochondrial SOD2. ET1 also increases superoxide in a manner that potentially impairs mitochondrial heme biosynthesis. In this study, organoid culture of BPA with ET1 (10nM) increases superoxide in the mitochondrial matrix and extra mitochondrial regions associated with COMP depletion, and COMP (0.5M) inhibited these superoxide increases. Since mitochondrial matrix superoxide could impair heme biosynthesis from protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) by decreasing Fe(2+) availability and/or ferrochelatase (FECH), we studied ET1, COMP and COMP siRNA effects on the expression of FECH, transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1, an indicator of iron availability) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC, a key heme-dependent protein), and on measurements of PpIX (HPLC) and heme content. ET1 decreased FECH, heme and sGC, and increased TfR1 and iron. COMP reversed these effects of ET1, and COMP decreased PpIX and increased heme in the absence of ET1. COMP siRNA increased PpIX detection and TfR1 expression, and decreased the expression of FECH and sGC. Nitric oxide (spermine NONOate) relaxation of BPA was inhibited by ET1, and this was attenuated by COMP during exposure to ET1. Thus, COMP depletion by ET1 or siRNA modulates pulmonary artery iron metabolism, which results in loss of heme biosynthesis and heme-dependent cGMP mechanisms.","10.1152/ajplung.00534.2020",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1459,"Methionine deficiency and its hydroxy analogue influence chicken intestinal 3-dimensional organoid development.; Chicken intestinal organoid and Chicken serum and Methionine; Methionine and its hydroxy analogue (MHA) have been shown to benefit mouse intestinal regeneration. The intestinal organoid is a good model that directly reflects the impact of certain nutrients or chemicals on intestinal development. Here, we aimed to establish a chicken intestinal organoid culture method first and then use the model to explore the influence of methionine deficiency and MHA on intestinal organoid development. The results showed that 125-m cell strainer exhibited the highest efficiency for chicken embryo crypt harvesting. We found that transforming growth factor- inhibitor (A8301) supplementation promoted enterocyte differentiation at the expense of the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISC). The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 inhibitor (SB202190) promoted intestinal organoid formation and enterocyte differentiation but suppressed the differentiation of enteroendocrine cells, goblet cells and Paneth cells. However, the suppression of enteroendocrine cell and Paneth cell differentiation by SB202190 was alleviated at the presence of A8301. The glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), valproic acid (VPA) alone and their combination promoted chicken intestinal organoid formation and enterocyte differentiation at the expense of the expression of Paneth cells and goblet cells. Chicken serum significantly improved organoid formation, especially in the presence of A8301, SB202190, CHIR99021, and VPA, but inhibited the differentiation of Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells. Chicken serum at a concentration of 0.25% meets the requirement of chicken intestinal organoid development, and the beneficial effect of chicken serum on chicken intestinal organoid culture could not be replaced by fetal bovine serum and insulin-like growth factor-1. Moreover, commercial mouse organoid culture medium supplemented with A8301, SB202190, CHIR99021, VPA, and chicken serum promotes chicken organoid budding. Based on the chicken intestinal organoid model, we found that methionine deficiency mimicked by cycloleucine suppressed organoid formation and organoid size, and this effect was reinforced with increased cycloleucine concentrations. Methionine hydroxy analogue promoted regeneration of ISC but decreased cell differentiation compared with the results obtained with L-methionine. In conclusion, our results provide a potentially excellent guideline for chicken intestinal organoid culture and insights into methionine function in crypt development.","10.1016/j.aninu.2021.06.001",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

In this study, we examined the involvement of the cell adhesion molecule CD146/MCAM in regulating GBM aggressiveness. Analyses of GBM transcript expression databases revealed correlations of elevated CD146 levels with higher glioma grades, IDH-wildtype and unmethylated MGMT phenotypes, poor response to chemo-radiotherapy and worse overall survival. In a panel of GBM stem cells (GSCs) variable expression levels of CD146 were detected, which strongly increased upon adherent growth. CD146 was linked with mesenchymal transition since expression increased in TGF--treated U-87MG cells. Ectopic overexpression of CD146/GFP in GG16 cells enhanced the mesenchymal phenotype and resulted in increased cell invasion. Conversely, GSC23-CD146 knockouts had decreased mesenchymal marker expression and reduced cell invasion in transwell and GBM-cortical assembloid assays. Moreover, using GSC23 xenografted zebrafish, we found that CD146 depletion resulted in more compact delineated tumor formation and reduced tumor cell dissemination. Stem cell marker expression and neurosphere formation assays showed that CD146 increased the stem cell potential of GSCs. Furthermore, CD146 mediated radioresistance by stimulating cell survival signaling through suppression of p53 expression and activation of NF-B. Interestingly, CD146 was also identified as an inducer of the oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP). In conclusion, CD146 carries out various pro-tumorigenic roles in GBM involving its cell surface receptor function, which include the stimulation of mesenchymal and invasive properties, stemness, and radiotherapy resistance, thus providing an interesting target for therapy.","10.1007/s00018-022-04420-0",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Here, we examine all six such amino acid substitutions in three proteins known to have key roles in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation and to be highly expressed in the stem cells of the developing neocortex. When we introduce these modern human-specific substitutions in mice, three substitutions in two of these proteins, KIF18a and KNL1, cause metaphase prolongation and fewer chromosome segregation errors in apical progenitors of the developing neocortex. Conversely, the ancestral substitutions cause shorter metaphase length and more chromosome segregation errors in human brain organoids, similar to what we find in chimpanzee organoids.

1514,"Bile acids promote the caveolae-associated entry of swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus in porcine intestinal enteroids.; NA; Intestinal microbial metabolites have been increasingly recognized as important regulators of enteric viral infection. However, very little information is available about which specific microbiota-derived metabolites are crucial for swine enteric coronavirus (SECoV) infection in vivo. Using swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS)-CoV as a model, we were able to identify a greatly altered bile acid (BA) profile in the small intestine of infected piglets by untargeted metabolomic analysis. Using a newly established ex vivo model-the stem cell-derived porcine intestinal enteroid (PIE) culture-we demonstrated that certain BAs, cholic acid (CA) in particular, enhance SADS-CoV replication by acting on PIEs at the early phase of infection. We ruled out the possibility that CA exerts an augmenting effect on viral replication through classic farnesoid X receptor or Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 signaling, innate immune suppression or viral attachment. BA induced multiple cellular responses including rapid changes in caveolae-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification and dynamics of the endosomal/lysosomal system that are critical for SADS-CoV replication. Thus, our findings shed light on how SECoVs exploit microbiome-derived metabolite BAs to swiftly establish viral infection and accelerate replication within the intestinal microenvironment.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1010620",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1524,"Taking molecular pathology to the next level: Whole slide multicolor confocal imaging with the Pannoramic Confocal digital pathology scanner.; 3-dimensional virtual slide and deconvolution and digital pathology and multispectral fluorescence imaging and widefield aperture correlated confocal imaging; The emergence and fast advance of digital pathology allows the acquisition, digital storage, interactive recall and analysis of morphology at the tissue level. When applying immunohistochemistry, it also affords the correlation of morphology with the expression of one or two specific molecule of interest. The rise of fluorescence pathology scanners expands the number of detected molecules based on multiplex labelling. The Pannoramic Confocal (created by 3DHistech, Hungary) is a first-of-the-kind digital pathology scanner that affords not only multiplexed fluorescent detection on top of conventional transmission imaging, but also confocality. We have benchmarked this scanner in terms of stability, precision, light efficiency, linearity and sensitivity. X-Y stability and relocalisation precision were well below resolution limit (50 nm). Light throughput in confocal mode was 4-5 times higher than that of a point scanning confocal microscope, yielding similar calculated confocal intensities but with the potential for improving signal to noise ratio or scan speed. Response was linear with R(2) 0.9996. Calibrated measurements showed that using indirect labeling 2000 molecules per cell could be well detected and imaged on the cell surface. Both standard-based and statistical post-acquisition flatfield corrections are implemented. We have also measured the point spread function (PSF) of the instrument. The dimensions of the PSF are somewhat larger and less symmetric than of the theoretical PSF of a conventional CLSM, however, the spatial homogeneity of these parameters allows for obtaining a specific system PSF for each optical path and using it for optional on-the-fly deconvolution. In conclusion, the Pannoramic Confocal provides sensitive, quantitative widefield and confocal detection of multiplexed fluorescence signals, with optical sectioning and 3D reconstruction, in addition to brightfield transmission imaging. High speed scanning of large samples, analysis of tissue heterogeneity, and detection of rare events open up new ways for quantitatively analyzing tissue sections, organoid cultures or large numbers of adherent cells.","10.1002/cyto.a.24675",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1564,"Development of Bovine Gastric Organoids as a Novel In Vitro Model to Study Host-Parasite Interactions in Gastrointestinal Nematode Infections; NA; Gastro-intestinal nematode (GIN) parasites are a major cause of production losses in grazing cattle, primarily through reduced growth rates in young animals. Control of these parasites relies heavily on anthelmintic drugs; however, with growing reports of resistance to currently available anthelmintics, alternative methods of control are required. A major hurdle in this work has been the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro infection models that has made studying precise interactions between the host and the GINs difficult. Such mechanistic insights into the infection process will be valuable for the development of novel targets for drugs, vaccines, or other interventions. Here we created bovine gastric epithelial organoids from abomasal gastric tissue and studied their application as in vitro models for understanding host invasion by GIN parasites. Transcriptomic analysis of gastric organoids across multiple passages and the corresponding abomasal tissue showed conserved expression of tissue-specific genes across samples, demonstrating that the organoids are representative of bovine gastric tissue from which they were derived. We also show that self-renewing and self-organising three-dimensional organoids can also be serially passaged, cryopreserved, and resuscitated. Using Ostertagia ostertagi, the most pathogenic gastric parasite in cattle in temperate regions, we show that cattle gastric organoids are biologically relevant models for studying GIN invasion in the bovine abomasum. Within 24 h of exposure, exsheathed larvae rapidly and repeatedly infiltrated the lumen of the organoids. Prior to invasion by the parasites, the abomasal organoids rapidly expanded, developing a 'ballooning' phenotype. Ballooning of the organoids could also be induced in response to exposure to parasite excretory/secretory products. In summary, we demonstrate the power of using abomasal organoids as a physiologically relevant in vitro model system to study interactions of O. ostertagi and other GIN with bovine gastrointestinal epithelium.","10.3389/fcimb.2022.904606",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1622,"Intramammary rapamycin administration to calves induces epithelial stem cell self-renewal and latent cell proliferation and milk protein expression; NA; Mammary epithelial stem cells differentiate to create the basal and luminal layers of the gland. Inducing the number of differentiating bovine mammary stem cells may provide compensating populations for the milk-producing cells that die during lactation. Inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin signals self-renewal of intestinal stem cells, with similar consequences in the mouse mammary gland and in bovine mammary implants maintained in mice. The implementation of these results in farm animals for better mammary development and production was studied in 3-month-old calves. mTOR activity decreased by ~50% in mammary epithelial cells subjected to 3-week rapamycin administration, with no negative consequences on mammary morphology or beta-casein expression. Subsequently, stem cell self-renewal was induced, reflected by a higher propagation rate of cultures from rapamycin-treated glands compared to respective controls and higher expression of selected markers. Followed by 4-day estrogen and progesterone administration, rapamycin significantly induced proliferation rate. Higher numbers of basal and luminal PCNA+ cells were detected in small ducts near the elongating sites as compared to large ducts, in which only luminal cells were affected. Rapamycin administration resulted in induction of individual milk protein genes' expression, which was negatively correlated to their endogenous levels. The inductive effect of rapamycin on luminal cell number was confirmed in organoid cultures, but milk protein expression decreased, probably due to lack of oscillation in rapamycin levels. In conclusion, intramammary rapamycin administration is an effective methodology to reduce mTOR activity in bovine mammary epithelial cells and consequently, induce stem cell self-renewal. The latent positive effect of rapamycin on epithelial cell proliferation and its potential to improve milk protein expression in calves may have beneficial implications for mature cows.","10.1371/journal.pone.0269505",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1638,"Comparison of the Response to the CXCR4 Antagonist AMD3100 during the Development of Retinal Organoids Derived from ES Cells and Zebrafish Retina.; C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and retinal development and retinal organoid and zebrafish; Retinal organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells or iPSCs recreate the key structural and functional features of mammalian retinal tissue in vitro. However, the differences in the development of retinal organoids and normal retina in vivo are not well defined. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the development of retinal organoids and zebrafish retina after inhibition of CXCR4, a key role in neurogenesis and optic nerve development, with the antagonist AMD3100. Our data indicated that CXCR4 was mainly expressed in ganglion cells in retinal organoids and was rarely expressed in amacrine or photoreceptor cells. AMD3100 treatment reduced the retinal organoid generation ratio, impaired differentiation, and induced morphological changes. Ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and photoreceptors were decreased and abnormal locations were observed in organoids treated with AMD3100. Neuronal axon outgrowth was also damaged in retinal organoids. Similarly, a decrease of ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and photoreceptors and the distribution of neural outgrowth was induced by AMD3100 treatment in zebrafish retina. However, abnormal photoreceptor ensembles induced by AMD3100 treatment in the organoids were not detected in zebrafish retina. Therefore, our study suggests that although retinal organoids might provide a reliable model for reproducing a retinal developmental model, there is a difference between the organoids and the retina in vivo.","10.3390/ijms23137088",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1643,"MYCN induces cell-specific tumorigenic growth in RB1-proficient human retinal organoid and chicken retina models of retinoblastoma.; NA; Retinoblastoma is a rare, intraocular paediatric cancer that originates in the neural retina and is most frequently caused by bi-allelic loss of RB1 gene function. Other oncogenic mutations, such as amplification and increased expression of the MYCN gene, have been found even with proficient RB1 function. In this study, we investigated whether MYCN over-expression can drive carcinogenesis independently of RB1 loss-of-function mutations. The aim was to elucidate the events that result in carcinogenesis and identify the cancer cell-of-origin. We used the chicken retina, a well-established model for studying retinal neurogenesis, and established human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids as model systems. We over-expressed MYCN by electroporation of piggyBac genome-integrating expression vectors. We found that over-expression of MYCN induced tumorigenic growth with high frequency in RB1-proficient chicken retinas and human organoids. In both systems, the tumorigenic cells expressed markers for undifferentiated cone photoreceptor/horizontal cell progenitors. The over-expression resulted in metastatic retinoblastoma within 7-9 weeks in chicken. Cells expressing MYCN could be grown in vitro and, when orthotopically injected, formed tumours that infiltrated the sclera and optic nerve and expressed markers for cone progenitors. Investigation of the tumour cell phenotype determined that the potential for neoplastic growth was embryonic stage-dependent and featured a cell-specific resistance to apoptosis in the cone/horizontal cell lineage, but not in ganglion or amacrine cells. We conclude that MYCN over-expression is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis and that a cell-specific resistance to apoptosis in the cone/horizontal cell lineage mediates the cancer phenotype.","10.1038/s41389-022-00409-3",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1676,"Neurotensin Regulates Proliferation and Stem Cell Function in the Small Intestine in a Nutrient-Dependent Manner; NA; Background & Aims: Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are sensitive to dietary alterations and nutrient availability. Neurotensin (NT), a gut peptide localized predominantly to the small bowel and released by fat ingestion, stimulates the growth of intestinal mucosa under basal conditions and during periods of nutrient deprivation, suggesting a possible role for NT on ISC function. Method(s): Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (Lgr5-EGFP) NT wild type (Nt+/+) and Lgr5-EGFP NT knockout (Nt-/-) mice were fed ad libitum or fasted for 48 hours. Small intestine tissue and crypts were examined by gene expression analyses, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and crypt-derived organoid culture. Drosophila expressing NT in midgut enteroendocrine cells were fed a standard diet or low-energy diet and esg-green fluorescent protein+ ISCs were quantified via immunofluorescence. Result(s): Loss of NT impaired crypt cell proliferation and ISC function in a manner dependent on nutrient status. Under nutrient-rich conditions, NT stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 signaling and the expression of genes that promote cell-cycle progression, leading to crypt cell proliferation. Under conditions of nutrient depletion, NT stimulated WNT/beta-catenin signaling and promoted an ISC gene signature, leading to enhanced ISC function. NT was required for the induction of WNT/beta-catenin signaling and ISC-specific gene expression during nutrient depletion, and loss of NT reduced crypt cell proliferation and impaired ISC function and Lgr5 expression in the intestine during fasting. Conversely, the expression of NT in midgut enteroendocrine cells of Drosophila prevented loss of ISCs during nutrient depletion. Conclusion(s): Collectively, our findings establish an evolutionarily conserved role for NT in ISC maintenance during nutritional stress.

1817,"Chicken-derived RSPO1 and WNT3 contribute to maintaining longevity of chicken intestinal organoid cultures.; NA; Intestinal organoids are advanced cellular models, which are widely used in mammalian studies to mimic and study in vivo intestinal function and host-pathogen interactions. Growth factors WNT3 and RSPO1 are crucial for the growth of intestinal organoids. Chicken intestinal organoids are currently cultured with mammalian Wnt3a and Rspo1, however, maintaining their longevity has shown to be challenging. Based on the limited homology between mammalian and avian RSPO1, we expect that chicken-derived factors are required for the organoid cultures. Isolated crypts from embryonic tissue of laying hens were growing in the presence of chicken WNT3 and RSPO1, whereas growth in the presence of mammalian Wnt3a and Rspo1 was limited. Moreover, the growth was increased by using Prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) and a Forkhead box O1-inhibitor (FOXO1-inhibitor), allowing to culture these organoids for 15 passages. Furthermore, stem cells maintained their ability to differentiate into goblets, enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells in 2D structures. Overall, we show that chicken intestinal organoids can be cultured for multiple passages using chicken-derived WNT3 and RSPO1, PGE(2), and FOXO1-inhibitor.","10.1038/s41598-022-14875-7",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"
1952,"Ex vivo and in vivo suppression of SARS-CoV-2 with combinatorial AAV/RNAi expression vectors.; AAV and COVID-19 and RNAi and SARS-CoV-2 and adeno-associated virus and antiviral RNAi and mutational escape; Despite rapid development and deployment of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), clinically relevant modalities to curb the pandemic by directly attacking the virus on a genetic level remain highly desirable and are urgently needed. Here we comprehensively illustrate the capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors co-expressing a cocktail of three short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; RNAi triggers) directed against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and N genes as versatile and effective antiviral agents. In cultured monkey cells and human gut organoids, our most potent vector, SAVIOR (SARS virus repressor), suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection to background levels. Strikingly, in control experiments using single shRNAs, multiple SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants quickly emerged from infected cells within 24-48 h. Importantly, such adverse viral adaptation was fully prevented with the triple-shRNA AAV vector even during long-term cultivation. In addition, AAV-SAVIOR efficiently purged SARS-CoV-2 in a new model of chronically infected human intestinal cells. Finally, intranasal AAV-SAVIOR delivery using an AAV9 capsid moderately diminished viral loads and/or alleviated disease symptoms in hACE2-transgenic or wild-type mice infected with human or mouse SARS-CoV-2 strains, respectively. Our combinatorial and customizable AAV/RNAi vector complements ongoing global efforts to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and holds great potential for clinical translation as an original and flexible preventive or therapeutic antiviral measure.","10.1016/j.ymthe.2022.01.024",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

1979,"Organoids at the PUB: The Porcine Urinary Bladder Serves as a Pancreatic Niche for Advanced Cancer Modeling.; organ culture models and pancreatic cancer and stem cell differentiation and urinary bladder; Despite intensive research and progress in personalized medicine, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the deadliest cancer entities. Pancreatic duct-like organoids (PDLOs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) or pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs) provide unique tools to study early and late stage dysplasia and to foster personalized medicine. However, such advanced systems are neither rapidly nor easily accessible and require an in vivo niche to study tumor formation and interaction with the stroma. Here, the establishment of the porcine urinary bladder (PUB) is revealed as an advanced organ culture model for shaping an ex vivo pancreatic niche. This model allows pancreatic progenitor cells to enter the ductal and endocrine lineages, while PDLOs further mature into duct-like tissue. Accordingly, the PUB offers an ex vivo platform for earliest pancreatic dysplasia and cancer if PDLOs feature KRAS(G12D) mutations. Finally, it is demonstrated that PDOs-on-PUB i) resemble primary pancreatic cancer, ii) preserve cancer subtypes, iii) enable the study of niche epithelial crosstalk by spiking in pancreatic stellate and immune cells into the grafts, and finally iv) allow drug testing. In summary, the PUB advances the existing pancreatic cancer models by adding feasibility, complexity, and customization at low cost and high flexibility.","10.1002/adhm.202102345",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2021,"Bone Marrow MSC Secretome Increases Equine Articular Chondrocyte Collagen Accumulation and Their Migratory Capacities.; acellular therapy and cartilage organoids and cell secretome and chondral defects and extracellular vesicles and horse and in vitro repair and mesenchymal stem cells and osteoarthritis and tissue engineering; Equine osteoarthritis (OA) leads to cartilage degradation with impaired animal well-being, premature cessation of sport activity, and financial losses. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies are promising for cartilage repair, but face limitations inherent to the cell itself. Soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by MSCs are the alternatives to overcome those limitations while preserving MSC restorative properties. The effect of equine bone marrow MSC secretome on equine articular chondrocytes (eACs) was analyzed with indirect co-culture and/or MSC-conditioned media (CM). The expression of healthy cartilage/OA and proliferation markers was evaluated in eACs (monolayers or organoids). In vitro repair experiments with MSC-CM were made to evaluate the proliferation and migration of eACs. The presence of nanosized EVs in MSC-CM was appraised with nanoparticle tracking assay and transmission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrated that the MSC secretome influences eAC phenotype by increasing cartilage functionality markers and cell migration in a greater way than MSCs, which could delay OA final outcomes. This study makes acellular therapy an appealing strategy to improve equine OA treatments. However, the MSC secretome contains a wide variety of soluble mediators and small EVs, such as exosomes, and further investigation must be performed to understand the mechanisms occurring behind these promising effects.","10.3390/ijms23105795",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2138,"Microsurgical Methods to Isolate and Culture the Early Gastrula Dorsal Marginal Zone; NA; Marginal zone explants from Xenopus embryos can be used to expose cell behaviors and tissue movements that normally operate in dorsal tissues. Dorsal explants comprise the diverse set of progenitor cells found in dorsal tissues including mesendoderm, head mesoderm, prechordal mesoderm, endoderm with bottle cells, axial mesoderm of the prospective notochord, paraxial mesoderm of the somites, lateral plate mesoderm, neural ectoderm, and ectoderm. Unlike an organoid, the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) explant is ""organotypic"" in that microsurgery does not disrupt native tissue organization beyond manipulations needed to dissect the tissue from the embryo. An organotypic early gastrula DMZ explant preserves boundaries and close tissue associations in the native marginal zone. Depending on the stage, patterning and cell identities can be maintained in explants and tissue isolates. Local cell movements and behaviors may also be preserved; however, the large-scale biomechanical impact of their collective movements may be altered from those in the native marginal zone. For instance, involution is typically inhibited in the DMZ explant, precluding the two-layer association of mesoderm and prospective neural ectoderm normally achieved during gastrulation. DMZ explants may be mounted and imaged in a variety of ways, exposing interesting cell behaviors or collective movements such as mediolateral cell intercalation in the axial and paraxial mesoderm, apical constriction of bottle cells, and directional migration of mesendoderm. The flattened DMZ explant can also be used to study emergence of new tissue-defining boundaries such as the notochord-somite boundary, the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary, and the mesendoderm-mesoderm boundary.","10.1101/pdb.prot097360",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2156,"Recombinant Limb Assay as in Vivo Organoid Model.; cell differentiation and limb development and limb organoid and organoid and patterning and recombinant limbs; Organ formation initiates once cells become committed to one of the three embryonic germ layers. In the early stages of embryogenesis, different gene transcription networks regulate cell fate after each germ layer is established, thereby directing the formation of complex tissues and functional organs. These events can be modeled in vitro by creating organoids from induced pluripotent, embryonic, or adult stem cells to study organ formation. Under these conditions, the induced cells are guided down the developmental pathways as in embryonic development, resulting in an organ of a smaller size that possesses the essential functions of the organ of interest. Although organoids are widely studied, the formation of skeletal elements in an organoid model has not yet been possible. Therefore, we suggest that the formation of skeletal elements using the recombinant limb (RL) assay system can serve as an in vivo organoid model. RLs are formed from undissociated or dissociated-reaggregated undifferentiated mesodermal cells introduced into an ectodermal cover obtained from an early limb bud. Next, this filled ectoderm is grafted into the back of a donor chick embryo. Under these conditions, the cells can receive the nascent embryonic signals and develop complex skeletal elements. We propose that the formation of skeletal elements induced through the RL system may occur from stem cells or other types of progenitors, thus enabling the study of morphogenetic properties in vivo from these cells for the first time.","10.3389/fcell.2022.863140",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2175,"A Single-Cell Culture System for Dissecting Microenvironmental Signaling in Development and Disease of Cartilage Tissue.; arthritis and chondrogenic organoid and chondrosphere and clonogenicity and microenvironment and niche and single cell; Cartilage tissue is comprised of extracellular matrix and chondrocytes, a cell type with very low cellular turnover in adults, providing limited capacity for regeneration. However, in development a significant number of chondrocytes actively proliferate and remodel the surrounding matrix. Uncoupling the microenvironmental influences that determine the balance between clonogenic potential and terminal differentiation of these cells is essential for the development of novel approaches for cartilage regeneration. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are not applicable for the analysis of functional properties of chondrocytes at a single cell resolution. Here we demonstrate that a novel 3D culture method provides a long-term and permissive in vitro niche that selects for highly clonogenic, colony-forming chondrocytes which maintain cartilage-specific matrix production, thus recapitulating the in vivo niche. As a proof of concept, clonogenicity of Sox9 (IRES-EGFP) mouse chondrocytes is almost exclusively found in the highest GFP(+) fraction known to be enriched for chondrocyte progenitor cells. Although clonogenic chondrocytes are very rare in adult cartilage, we have optimized this system to support large, single cell-derived chondrogenic organoids with complex zonal architecture and robust chondrogenic phenotype from adult pig and human articular chondrocytes. Moreover, we have demonstrated that growth trajectory and matrix biosynthesis in these organoids respond to a pro-inflammatory environment. This culture method offers a robust, defined and controllable system that can be further used to interrogate the effects of various microenvironmental signals on chondrocytes, providing a high throughput platform to assess genetic and environmental factors in development and disease.","10.3389/fcell.2021.725854",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

NMR would clearly be beneficial for analysis of entities at the microscopic scale of about 1 nL (the nanoliter scale), typical of early development of mammalian embryos, microtissues and organoids: the scale where the building blocks of complex organisms could be observed. However, the handling of such small samples (about 100 m) and sensitivity issues have prevented a widespread adoption of NMR. In this article we show how these limitations can be overcome to obtain NMR spectra of a mammalian embryo in its early stage. To achieve this we employ ultra-compact micro-chip technologies in combination with 3D-printed micro-structures. Such device is packaged for use as plug & play sensor and it shows sufficient sensitivity to resolve NMR signals from individual bovine pre-implantation embryos. The embryos in this study are obtained through In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) techniques, transported cryopreserved to the NMR laboratory, and measured shortly after thawing. In less than 1 h these spherical samples of just 130-190 m produce distinct spectral peaks, largely originating from lipids contained inside them. We further observe how the spectra vary from one sample to another despite their optical and morphological similarities, suggesting that the method can further develop into a non-invasive embryo assay for selection prior to embryo transfer.","10.1016/j.jmr.2021.107142",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

2236,"Foregut organ progenitors and their niche display distinct viscoelastic properties in vivo during early morphogenesis stages.; NA; Material properties of living matter play an important role for biological function and development. Yet, quantification of material properties of internal organs in vivo, without causing physiological damage, remains challenging. Here, we present a non-invasive approach based on modified optical tweezers for quantifying sub-cellular material properties deep inside living zebrafish embryos. Material properties of cells within the foregut region are quantified as deep as 150m into the biological tissue through measurements of the positions of an inert tracer. This yields an exponent, , which characterizes the scaling behavior of the positional power spectra and the complex shear moduli. The measurements demonstrate differential mechanical properties: at the time when the developing organs undergo substantial displacements during morphogenesis, gut progenitors are more elastic ( = 0.570.07) than the neighboring yolk ( = 0.730.08), liver ( = 0.660.06) and two mesodermal ( = 0.680.06,  = 0.640.06) progenitor cell populations. The higher elasticity of gut progenitors correlates with an increased cellular concentration of microtubules.

2266,"Retinal organoids derived from rhesus macaque iPSCs undergo accelerated differentiation compared to human stem cells.; human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells and organoids and retina and tissue engineering; PURPOSE: To compare the timing and efficiency of the development of Macaca mulatta, a nonhuman primate (NHP), induced pluripotent stem cell (rhiPSC) derived retinal organoids to those derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). RESULTS: Generation of retinal organoids was achieved from both human and several NHP pluripotent stem cell lines. All rhiPSC lines resulted in retinal differentiation with the formation of optic vesicle-like structures similar to what has been observed in hESC retinal organoids. NHP retinal organoids had laminated structure and were composed of mature retinal cell types including cone and rod photoreceptors. Single-cell RNA sequencing was conducted at two time points; this allowed identification of cell types and developmental trajectory characterization of the developing organoids. Important differences between rhesus and human cells were measured regarding the timing and efficiency of retinal organoid differentiation. While the culture of NHP-derived iPSCs is relatively difficult compared to that of human stem cells, the generation of retinal organoids from NHP iPSCs is feasible and may be less time-consuming due to an intrinsically faster timing of retinal differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal organoids produced from rhesus monkey iPSCs using established protocols differentiate through the stages of organoid development faster than those derived from human stem cells. The production of NHP retinal organoids may be advantageous to reduce experimental time for basic biology studies in retinogenesis as well as for preclinical trials in NHPs studying retinal allograft transplantation.","10.1111/cpr.13198",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2267,"In vivo potency assay for the screening of bioactive molecules on cartilage formation; NA; Cartilage regeneration is a priority in medicine for the treatment of osteoarthritis and isolated cartilage defects. Several molecules with potential for cartilage regeneration are under investigation. Unfortunately, in vitro chondrogenesis assays do not always predict the stability of the newly formed cartilage in vivo. Therefore, there is a need for a stringent, quantifiable assay to assess in vivo the capacity of molecules to promote the stable formation of cartilage that is resistant to calcification and endochondral bone formation. We developed an ectopic cartilage formation assay (ECFA) that enables one to assess the capacity of bioactive molecules to support cartilage formation in vivo using cartilage organoids. The ECFA predicted good clinical outcomes when used as a quality control for efficacy of chondrocyte preparations before implantation in patients with cartilage defects. In this assay, articular chondrocytes from human donors or animals are injected either intramuscularly or subcutaneously in nude mice. As early as 2 weeks later, cartilage organoids can be retrieved. The size of the implants and their degree of differentiation can be assessed by histomorphometry, immunostainings of molecular markers and real-time PCR. Mineralization can be assessed by micro-computed tomography or by staining. The effects of molecules on cartilage formation can be tested following the systemic administration of the molecule in mice previously injected with chondrocytes, or after co-injection of chondrocytes with cell lines overexpressing and secreting the protein of interest.

However, ZhenNing (ZN) Hens, a native chicken breed in China, are known for their unique flavour. The intestinal mucosa, which is the main organ for nutrient absorption, could affect livestock product quality. In ZN Hens' intestinal mucosa, we found more villus wrinkles, larger villus circumference and higher amino acid transporters mRNA abundance compared with HL Hens. Among three laying periods of ZN Hens, in the intestinal lumen, Lactobacillus salivarius (L. sa.), Lactobacillus agilis (L. ag.) and Lactobacillus aviarius were the predominant species in the laying peak period. Furthermore, multiple-antibiotics feeding in ZN Hens and predominant Lactobacillus feeding in HL Hens suggested that these Lactobacilli could indeed increase villus wrinkles and improve intestinal absorption. In HL Hens, L. sa. + L. ag. treatment could promote organoids budding in vitro, and promote epithelial proliferation in vivo. Collectively, the unique intestinal mucosa morphology in ZN Hens was due to the high abundance of intestinal L. sa. and L. ag. Transplant these Lactobacilli to HL Hens could increase their intestinal probiotics abundance, fine adjust the intestinal stem cell function and promote the epithelial proliferation, in turn, increase villus winkles and mucosal absorption area.","10.1111/1751-7915.13917",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2283,"Coronavirus Porcine Deltacoronavirus Upregulates MHC Class I Expression through RIG-I/IRF1-Mediated NLRC5 Induction.; IRF1 and MHC class I and NLRC5 and PDCoV and coronavirus and interferon; Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and MHC-II molecules, mainly being responsible for the processing and presentation of intracellular or extracellular antigen, respectively, are critical for antiviral immunity. Here, we reported that porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) with the zoonotic potential and potential spillover from pigs to humans, upregulated the expressions of porcine MHC-I (swine leukocyte antigen class I, SLA-I) molecules and SLA-I antigen presentation associated genes instead of porcine MHC-II (SLA-II) molecules both in primary porcine enteroids and swine testicular (ST) cells at the late stage of infection, and this finding was verified in vivo. Moreover, the induction of SLA-I molecules by PDCoV infection was mediated through enhancing the expression of NOD-like receptor (NLR) family caspase recruitment domain-containing 5 (NLRC5). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that PDCoV infection robustly elevated retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) expression, and further initiated the downstream type I interferon beta (IFN-) production, which led to the upregulation of NLRC5 and SLA-I genes. Likewise, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) elicited by PDCoV infection directly activated the promoter activity of NLRC5, resulting in an increased expression of NLRC5 and SLA-I upregulation. Taken together, our findings advance our understanding of how PDCoV manipulates MHC molecules, and knowledge that could help inform the development of therapies and vaccines against PDCoV. IMPORTANCE MHC-I molecules play a crucial role in antiviral immunity by presenting intracellular antigens to CD8(+)T lymphocytes and eliminating virus-infected cells by natural killer cells' ""missing-self recognition."" However, the manipulation of MHC molecules by coronaviruses remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that PDCoV, a zoonotic potential coronavirus efficiently infecting cells from broad species, greatly increased the expressions of porcine MHC-I (SLA-I) molecules and MHC-I antigen presentation associated genes but not porcine MHC-II (SLA-II) molecules both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the upregulation of MHC-I molecules by PDCoV infection required the master transactivator of MHC-I, NLRC5, which was mediated not only by RIG-I-initiated type I IFN signaling pathway but also by IRF1 induced by PDCoV as it could activate NLRC5 promoter activity. These results provide significant insights into the modification of the MHC class I pathway and may provide a potential therapeutic intervention for PDCoV.","10.1128/jvi.00158-22",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2293,"Extracellular matrix bioink boosts stemness and facilitates transplantation of intestinal organoids as a biosafe Matrigel alternative; NA; Organoids hold inestimable therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine and are increasingly serving as an in vitro research platform. Still, their expanding applications are critically restricted by the canonical culture matrix and system. Synthesis of a suitable bioink of bioactivity, biosecurity, tunable stiffness, and printability to replace conventional matrices and fabricate customized culture systems remains challenging. Here, we envisaged a novel bioink formulation based on decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) from porcine small intestinal submucosa for organoids bioprinting, which provides intestinal stem cells (ISCs) with niche-specific ECM content and biomimetic microstructure. Intestinal organoids cultured in the fabricated bioink exhibited robust generation as well as a distinct differentiation pattern and transcriptomic signature. This bioink established a new co-culture system able to study interaction between epithelial homeostasis and submucosal cells and promote organoids maturation after transplantation into the mesentery of immune-deficient NODSCID-gamma (NSG) mice. In summary, the development of such photo-responsive bioink has the potential to replace tumor-derived Matrigel and facilitate the application of organoids in translational medicine and disease modeling.","10.1002/btm2.10327",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Here, we designed a robust long-term culture system for porcine intestinal organoids from the intestinal crypt or single LGR5(+) stem cell by combining previously defined insights into the growth requirements of the intestinal epithelium of humans. We showed that long-term cultured swine intestinal organoids were expanded in vitro for more than 6 months and maintained the potential to differentiate into different types of cells. These organoids were successfully infected with porcine enteric coronavirus, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and were capable of supporting virus replication and progeny release. RNA-seq analysis showed robust induction of transcripts associated with antiviral signaling in response to enteric coronavirus infection, including hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes and cytokines. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis indicated that PEDV infection could suppress the immune response in organoids. This 3D intestinal organoid model offers a long-term, renewable resource for investigating porcine intestinal infections with various pathogens.","10.3389/fmicb.2022.865336",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2337,"In Vivo Photocontrol of Microtubule Dynamics and Integrity, Migration and Mitosis, by the Potent GFP-Imaging-Compatible Photoswitchable Reagents SBTubA4P and SBTub2M.; NA; Photoswitchable reagents are powerful tools for high-precision studies in cell biology. When these reagents are globally administered yet locally photoactivated in two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, they can exert micron- and millisecond-scale biological control. This gives them great potential for use in biologically more relevant three-dimensional (3D) models and in vivo, particularly for studying systems with inherent spatiotemporal complexity, such as the cytoskeleton. However, due to a combination of photoswitch isomerization under typical imaging conditions, metabolic liabilities, and insufficient water solubility at effective concentrations, the in vivo potential of photoswitchable reagents addressing cytosolic protein targets remains largely unrealized. Here, we optimized the potency and solubility of metabolically stable, druglike colchicinoid microtubule inhibitors based on the styrylbenzothiazole (SBT) scaffold that are nonresponsive to typical fluorescent protein imaging wavelengths and so enable multichannel imaging studies. We applied these reagents both to 3D organoids and tissue explants and to classic model organisms (zebrafish, clawed frog) in one- and two-protein imaging experiments, in which spatiotemporally localized illuminations allowed them to photocontrol microtubule dynamics, network architecture, and microtubule-dependent processes in vivo with cellular precision and second-level resolution. These nanomolar, in vivo capable photoswitchable reagents should open up new dimensions for high-precision cytoskeleton research in cargo transport, cell motility, cell division, and development. More broadly, their design can also inspire similarly capable optical reagents for a range of cytosolic protein targets, thus bringing in vivo photopharmacology one step closer to general realization.","10.1021/jacs.2c01020",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2341,"Tumor Targeting with Bacterial Shiga Toxin B Subunit in Genetic Porcine Models for Colorectal Cancer and Osteosarcoma.; NA; The B subunit of bacterial Shiga toxin (STxB) is nontoxic and has low immunogenicity. Its receptor, the glycosphingolipid Gb3/CD77, is overexpressed on the cell surface of human colorectal cancer. We tested whether genetic porcine models, closely resembling human anatomy and pathophysiology, can be used to exploit the tumor-targeting potential of STxB. In accordance with findings on human colorectal cancer, the pig model APC1311 bound STxB in colorectal tumors, but not in normal colon or jejunum, except for putative enteroendocrine cells. In primary tumor cells from endoscopic biopsies, STxB was rapidly taken up along the retrograde intracellular route to the Golgi, whereas normal colon organoids did not bind or internalize STxB. Next, we tested a porcine model (TP53LSL-R167H) for osteosarcoma, a tumor entity with a dismal prognosis and insufficient treatment options, hitherto not known to express Gb3. Pig osteosarcoma strongly bound StxB and expressed the Gb3 synthase 1,4-galactosyltransferase (A4GALT). Primary osteosarcoma cells, but not normal osteoblasts, rapidly internalized fluorescently labeled STxB along the retrograde route to the Golgi. Importantly, six of eight human osteosarcoma cell lines expressed A4GALT mRNA and showed prominent intracellular uptake of STxB. The physiologic role of A4GALT was tested by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in porcine LLC-PK1 kidney epithelial cells and RNAi in MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells. A4GALT deficiency or knockdown abolished STxB uptake and led to significantly reduced cell migration and proliferation, hinting toward a putative tumor-promoting role of Gb3. Thus, pig models are suitable tools for STxB-based tumor targeting and may allow ""reverse-translational"" predictions on human tumor biology.","10.1158/1535-7163.mct-21-0445",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2388,"Establishment and characterization of equine mammary organoids using a method translatable to other non-traditional model species.; Budding and Epidermal growth factor and Equine and Mammary organoid and Non-traditional model species and Prolactin; Mammary organoid (MaO) models are only available for a few traditional model organisms, limiting our ability to investigate mammary gland development and cancer across mammals. This study established equine mammary organoids (EqMaOs) from cryopreserved mammary tissue, in which mammary tissue fragments were isolated and embedded into a 3D matrix to produce EqMaOs. We evaluated viability, proliferation and budding capacity of EqMaOs at different time points during culture, showing that although the number of proliferative cells decreased over time, viability was maintained and budding increased. We further characterized EqMaOs based on expression of stem cell, myoepithelial and luminal markers, and found that EqMaOs expressed these markers throughout culture and that a bilayered structure as seen in vivo was recapitulated. We used the milk-stimulating hormone prolactin to induce milk production, which was verified by the upregulation of milk proteins, most notably -casein. Additionally, we showed that our method is also applicable to additional non-traditional mammalian species, particularly domesticated animals such as cats, pigs and rabbits. Collectively, MaO models across species will be a useful tool for comparative developmental and cancer studies.","10.1242/dev.200412",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2422,"Mammosphere Culture of Mammary Cells from Cynomolgus Macaques (Macaca fascicularis).; NA; The mammary gland contains adult stem cells that are capable of self-renewal. Although these cells hold an important role in the biology and pathology of the breast, the studies of mammary stem cells are few due to the difficulty of acquiring and expanding undifferentiated adult stem cell populations. In this study, we developed mammosphere cultures from frozen mammary cells of nulliparous cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) as a culture system to enrich mammary stem cells. Small samples of mammary tissues were collected by surgical biopsy; cells were cultured in epithelial cell growth medium and cryopreserved. Cryopreserved cells were cultured into mammospheres, and the expression of markers for stemness was evaluated by using quantitative PCR analysis. Cells were further differentiated by using 2D and 3D approaches to evaluate morphology and organoid budding, respectively. The study showed that mammosphere culture resulted in an increase in the expression of mammary stem cell markers with each passage. In contrast, markers for epithelial cells and pluripotency decreased across multiple passages. The 2D differentiation of the cells showed heterogeneous morphology, whereas 3D differentiation allowed for organoid formation. The results indicate that mammospheres can be successfully developed from frozen mammary cells derived from breast tissue collected from nulliparous cynomolgus macaques through surgical biopsy. Because mammosphere cultures allow for the enrichment of a mammary stem cell population, this refined method provides a model for the in vitro or ex vivo study of mammary stem cells.","10.30802/aalas-cm-18-000030",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2428,"Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection Mediated Changes in Jejunum and Peripheral SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2 and Associated Proteins or Genes in Rhesus Macaques; NA; Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and associated proteins play a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological events, such as immune activation, inflammation, gut barrier maintenance, intestinal stem cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Although many of these clinical events are quite significant in SIV/HIV infection, expression profiling of these proteins has not been well reported. Considering the different pathological consequences in the gut after HIV infection, we hypothesized that the expression of ACE2 and associated proteins of the Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could be compromised after SIV/HIV infection. We quantified the gene expression of ACE2 as well as AGTR1/2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2, and compared between SIV infected and uninfected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; hereafter abbreviated RMs). The gene expression analysis revealed significant downregulation of ACE2 and upregulation of AGTR2 and inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the gut of infected RMs. Protein expression profiling also revealed significant upregulation of AGTR2 after infection. The expression of ACE2 in protein level was also decreased, but not significantly, after infection. To understand the entirety of the process in newly regenerated epithelial cells, a global transcriptomic study of enteroids raised from intestinal stem cells was performed. Interestingly, most of the genes associated with the RAS, such as DPP4, MME, ANPEP, ACE2, ENPEP, were found to be downregulated in SIV infection. HNFA1 was found to be a key regulator of ACE2 and related protein expression. Jejunum CD4+ T cell depletion and increased IL-6 mRNA, MCP-1 and AGTR2 expression may signal inflammation, monocyte/macrophage accumulation and epithelial apoptosis in accelerating SIV pathogenesis. Overall, the findings in the study suggested a possible impact of SIV/HIV infection on expression of ACE2 and RAS-associated proteins resulting in the loss of gut homeostasis. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection remains uncertain and needs further investigation as the significance profile of ACE2, a viral entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and its expression in mRNA and protein varied in the current study. There is a concern of aggravated SARS-CoV-2 outcomes due to possible serious pathological events in the gut resulting from compromised expression of RAS- associated proteins in SIV/HIV infection.","10.3389/fimmu.2022.835686",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2438,"Canine Intestinal Organoids in a Dual-Chamber Permeable Support System.; NA; The permeable support system is typically used in conjunction with traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell lines as an in vitro tool for evaluating the oral permeability of new therapeutic drug candidates. However, the use of these conventional cell lines has limitations, such as altered expression of tight junctions, partial cell differentiation, and the absence of key nuclear receptors. Despite these shortcomings, the Caco-2 and MDCK models are widely accepted and validated for the prediction of human in vivo oral permeability. Dogs are a relevant translational model for biomedical research due to their similarities in gastrointestinal anatomy and intestinal microflora with humans. Accordingly, and in support of parallel drug development, the elaboration of an efficient and accurate in vitro tool for predicting in vivo drug permeability characteristics both in dogs and humans is highly desirable. Such a tool could be the canine intestinal organoid system, characterized by three-dimensional (3D), self-assembled epithelial structures derived from adult stem cells. The (1) Permeable Support Seeding Protocol describes the experimental methods for dissociating and seeding canine organoids in the inserts. Canine organoid isolation, culture, and harvest have been previously described in a separate set of protocols in this special issue.

2474,"Standardization and Maintenance of 3D Canine Hepatic and Intestinal Organoid Cultures for Use in Biomedical Research.; NA; Dogs develop complex multifactorial diseases analogous to humans, including inflammatory diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Therefore, they represent relevant large animal models with the translational potential to human medicine. Organoids are 3-dimensional (3D), self-assembled structures derived from stem cells that mimic the microanatomy and physiology of their organ of origin. These translational in vitro models can be used for drug permeability and discovery applications, toxicology assessment, and to provide a mechanistic understanding of the pathophysiology of multifactorial chronic diseases. Furthermore, canine organoids can enhance the lives of companion dogs, providing input in various areas of veterinary research and facilitating personalized treatment applications in veterinary medicine. A small group of donors can create a biobank of organoid samples, reducing the need for continuous tissue harvesting, as organoid cell lines can be sub-cultured indefinitely.

Patch grafting strategies were established enabling transplantation of 10(7th) organoids/patch of porcine GFP+ biliary tree stem/progenitors into livers of wild type hosts. Grafts consisted of organoids embedded in soft (~100 Pa) hyaluronan hydrogels, both prepared in serum-free Kubota's Medium; placed against target sites; covered with a silk backing impregnated with more rigid hyaluronan hydrogels (~700 Pa); and use of the backing to tether grafts with sutures or glue to target sites. Hyaluronan coatings (~200-300 Pa) onto the serosal surface of the graft served to minimize adhesions with neighboring organs. The organ's clearance of hyaluronans enabled restoration of tissue-specific paracrine and systemic signaling, resulting in return of normal hepatic histology, with donor parenchymal cells uniformly integrated amidst host cells and that had differentiated to mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Grafts containing donor mature hepatocytes, partnered with endothelia, and in the same graft biomaterials as for stem/progenitor organoids, did not engraft. Engraftment occurred if porcine liver-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were co-transplanted with donor mature cells. RNA-seq analyses revealed that engraftment correlated with expression of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially secreted isoforms that were found expressed strongly by organoids, less so by MSCs, and minimally, if at all, by adult cells. Engraftment with patch grafting strategies occurred without evidence of emboli or ectopic cell distribution. It was successful with stem/progenitor organoids or with cells with a source(s) of secreted MMP isoforms and offers significant potential for enabling cell therapies for solid organs.","10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.121067",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2566,"The Fibrillin-1/VEGFR2/STAT2 signaling axis promotes chemoresistance via modulating glycolysis and angiogenesis in ovarian cancer organoids and cells; NA; Background: Chemotherapy resistance is a primary reason of ovarian cancer therapy failure; hence it is important to investigate the underlying mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and develop novel potential therapeutic targets. Method(s): RNA sequencing of cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive (chemoresistant and chemosensitive, respectively) ovarian cancer organoids was performed, followed by detection of the expression level of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in organoids and clinical specimens of ovarian cancer. Subsequently, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, and chemosensitivity were analyzed in structural glycoprotein FBN1-knockout cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer organoids and cell lines. To gain insights into the specific functions and mechanisms of action of FBN1 in ovarian cancer, immunoprecipitation, silver nitrate staining, mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and Forster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging analyses were performed, followed by in vivo assays using vertebrate model systems of nude mice and zebrafish. Result(s): FBN1 expression was significantly enhanced in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer organoids and tissues, indicating that FBN1 might be a key factor in chemoresistance of ovarian cancer. We also discovered that FBN1 sustained the energy stress and induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, which promoted the cisplatin-resistance of ovarian cancer. Knockout of FBN1 combined with treatment of the antiangiogenic drug apatinib improved the cisplatin-sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, FBN1 mediated the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) at the Tyr1054 residue, which activated its downstream focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) pathway, induced the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) at the tyrosine residue 690 (Tyr690), promoted the nuclear translocation of STAT2, and ultimately altered the expression of genes associated with STAT2-mediated angiogenesis and glycolysis. Conclusion(s): The FBN1/VEGFR2/STAT2 signaling axis may induce chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells by participating in the process of glycolysis and angiogenesis. The present study suggested a novel FBN1-targeted therapy and/or combination of FBN1 inhibition and antiangiogenic drug for treating ovarian cancer.","10.1002/cac2.12274",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

In this study, we describe a method for generating confluent 2D enteroids from single-cell suspensions of enzymatically-dissociated ileum-derived bovine 3D enteroids. Confluent monolayers were first achieved using IntestiCult media but to establish a defined, cost-effective culture media, we also developed a bovine enteroid monolayer (BEM) medium.

Here, we present an overview of recent findings from comparisons of the neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) and neurons of hominids. In addition to differences in proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs, and maturation of neurons, we highlight that the regulation of the timing of these processes is emerging as a general foundational difference in the development of the neocortex of hominids.  2021 The Authors.

Tuft cells are taste-like chemosensory cells found in the intestinal epithelium involved in the activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). Although tuft cells in other tissues secrete the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), their function in the gut remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated changes in the expression of genes and cell differentiation of the intestinal epithelium by stimulation with interleukin-4 (IL-4) or IL-13 in macaque intestinal organoids. Transcriptome analysis showed that tuft cell marker genes were highly expressed in the IL-4- and IL-13-treated groups compared with the control, and the gene expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a synthesis enzyme of ACh, was upregulated in IL-4- and IL-13-treated groups. ACh accumulation was observed in IL-4-induced organoids using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS), and ACh strongly released granules from Paneth cells.

2766,"Lichenysin Production by Bacillus licheniformis Food Isolates and Toxicity to Human Cells; NA; Bacillus licheniformis can cause foodborne intoxication due to the production of the surfactant lichenysin. The aim of this study was to measure the production of lichenysin by food isolates of B. licheniformis in LB medium and skimmed milk and its cytotoxicity for intestinal cells. Out of 11 B. licheniformis isolates tested, most showed robust growth in high salt (1M NaCl), 4% ethanol, at 37 or 55degreeC, and aerobic and anaerobic conditions. All strains produced lichenysin (in varying amounts), but not all strains were hemolytic. Production of this stable compound by selected strains (high producers B4094 and B4123, and type strain DSM13T) was subsequently determined using LB medium and milk, at 37 and 55degreeC. Lichenysin production in LB broth and milk was not detected at cell densities < 5 log10 CFU/ml. The highest concentrations were found in the stationary phase of growth. Total production of lichenysin was 4-20 times lower in milk than in LB broth (maximum 36 mug/ml), and ~10 times lower in the biomass obtained from milk agar than LB agar. Under all conditions tested, strain B4094 consistently yielded the highest amounts. Besides strain variation and medium composition, temperature also had an effect on lichenysin production, with twofold lower amounts of lichenysin produced at 55degreeC than at 37degreeC. All three strains produced lichenysin A with varying acyl chain lengths (C11-C18). The relative abundance of the C14 variant was highest in milk and the C15 variant highest in LB. The concentration of lichenysin needed to reduce cell viability by 50% (IC50) was 16.6 mug/ml for Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells and 16.8 mug/ml for pig ileum organoids. Taken together, the presence of low levels (<5 log10 CFU/ml) of B. licheniformis in foods is unlikely to pose a foodborne hazard related to lichenysin production. However, depending on the strain present, the composition, and storage condition of the food, a risk of foodborne intoxication may arise if growth to high levels is supported and such product is ingested.","10.3389/fmicb.2022.831033",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2767,"From cohorts to molecules: Adverse impacts of endocrine disrupting mixtures.; NA; Convergent evidence associates exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with major human diseases, even at regulation-compliant concentrations. This might be because humans are exposed to EDC mixtures, whereas chemical regulation is based on a risk assessment of individual compounds. Here, we developed a mixture-centered risk assessment strategy that integrates epidemiological and experimental evidence. We identified that exposure to an EDC mixture in early pregnancy is associated with language delay in offspring. At human-relevant concentrations, this mixture disrupted hormone-regulated and disease-relevant regulatory networks in human brain organoids and in the model organisms Xenopus leavis and Danio rerio, as well as behavioral responses. Reinterrogating epidemiological data, we found that up to 54% of the children had prenatal exposures above experimentally derived levels of concern, reaching, for the upper decile compared with the lowest decile of exposure, a 3.3 times higher risk of language delay.","10.1126/science.abe8244",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2772,"From crypts to enteroids: establishment and characterization of avian intestinal organoids.; chicken intestines and crypt and organoid and three-dimensional cell culture; Intestinal organoids (IO), known as ""mini-guts"", derived from intestinal crypts, are self-organizing three-dimensional (3D) multicellular ex vivo models that recapitulate intestine epithelial structure and function and have been widely used for studying intestinal physiology, pathophysiology, molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions, and intestinal disease in mammals. However, studies on avian IO are limited and the development of long-term cultures of IO model for poultry research is lacking. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to generate crypt-derived organoids from chicken intestines and to optimize conditions for cell growth and enrichments, passages, and cryopreservation. Crypts were collected from the small intestines of birds at embryonic d-19 and ceca from layer and broiler chickens with ages ranging from d 1 to 20 wk, embedded in a basement membrane matrix, and cultured with organoid growth media (OGM) prepared in house. The crypt-derived organoids were successfully grown and propagated to form 3D spheres like structures that were cultured for up to 3 wk. Organoids were formed on d one, budding appeared on d 3, and robust budding was observed on d 7 and beyond. For cryopreservation, dissociated organoids were resuspended in a freezing medium. The characteristics of IO upon extended passages and freeze-thaw cycles were analyzed using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, immunoblotting, and live cell imaging. Immunoblotting and RT-PCR using E-cadherin (the marker for epithelial cells), leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5, the marker for stem cells), chromogranin A (the marker for enteroendocrine cells), lysozyme (the marker for Paneth cells), and mucin (the biomarker for goblet cells) confirmed that IO were composed of heterogeneous cell populations, including epithelial cells, stem cells, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, and goblet cells. Furthermore, OGM supplemented with both valproic acid and CHIR99021, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, increased the size of the avian IO (P < 0.001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report for establishing long-term, organoid culture models from small intestines and ceca of layer and broiler chickens. This model will facilitate elucidation of the mechanisms impacting host-pathogen interactions, eventually leading to the discovery of pathogen intervention strategies in poultry.","10.1016/j.psj.2021.101642",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

While the three SECoVs primarily infect intestinal epithelia in vivo and cause similar clinical signs, there are evident discrepancies in their cellular tropism and pathogenicity. However, the underlying mechanisms to cause the differences remain unclear. Herein, we employed porcine enteroids that are a physiologically relevant model of the intestine to assess the host epithelial responses following infection with the three SECoVs (PEDV, TGEV, and PDCoV). Although SECoVs replicated similarly in jejunal enteroids, a parallel comparison of transcriptomics datasets uncovered that PEDV and TGEV infection induced similar transcriptional profiles and exhibited a more pronounced response with more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in jejunal enteroids compared with PDCoV infection. Notably, TGEV and PDCoV induced high levels of type I and III IFNs and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) responses, while PEDV displayed a delayed peak and elicited a much lesser extent of IFN responses. Furthermore, TGEV and PDCoV instead of PEDV elicited a substantial upregulation of antigen-presentation genes and T cell-recruiting chemokines in enteroids. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that IFNs treatment markedly elevated the expression of NOD-like receptor (NLR) family NLRC5 and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. Together, our results indicate unique and common viral strategies for manipulating the global IFN responses and antigen presentation utilized by SECoVs, which help us a better understanding of host-SECoVs interactions.","10.3389/fimmu.2021.826882",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Investigations on gastrointestinal infectious diseases are classically performed in laboratory animals leading to the problem that species-specific models are scarcely available, especially when it comes to farm animals. The 3R principles of Russel and Burch were achieved using intestinal organoids of porcine jejunum. These organoids seem to be a promising tool to generate species-specific in vitro models of intestinal epithelium. 3D Organoids were grown in an extracellular matrix and characterized by qPCR. Organoids were also seeded on permeable filter supports in order to generate 2D epithelial monolayers. The organoid-based 2D monolayers were characterized morphologically and were investigated regarding their potential to study physiological transport properties and pathophysiological processes. They showed a monolayer structure containing different cell types. Moreover, their functional activity was demonstrated by their increasing transepithelial electrical resistance over 18 days and by an active glucose transport and chloride secretion. Furthermore, the organoid-based 2D monolayers were also confronted with cholera toxin derived from Vibrio cholerae as a proof of concept. Incubation with cholera toxin led to an increase of short-circuit current indicating an enhanced epithelial chloride secretion, which is a typical characteristic of cholera infections. Taken this together, our model allows the investigation of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms focusing on the small intestine of pigs. This is in line with the 3R principle and allows the reduction of classical animal experiments.","10.1371/journal.pone.0256143",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Fish liver cell lines have emerged as a promising culture system for these in vitro platforms because they complement the currently limited in vitro tools that mostly consist of mammalian cell lines and adhere to the 3Rs: replacement, reduction, and refinement of living animal tests. However, monolayer cell lines have lower transcriptional and physiological responses upon exposure to toxic chemicals than freshly isolated primary cells. To overcome this challenge, we utilized a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid-based in vitro platform, in which hepatocyte cells had self-organized into spheroid forms via E-cadherin bonds. This platform exhibited augmented transcriptomic and phenotypic regulation of liver cells in comparison to monolayer cells. We examined the organoid platform using the zebrafish liver (ZFL) cell line as a model system. ZFL cells spontaneously clustered into 3D spheroids with long-term viability by optimizing cell seeding density on a non-adherent substrate. Interestingly, 3D ZFL spheroids treated with estrogenic chemicals were activated to synthesize a higher level of vitellogenin (Vtg) than monolayer cells. Whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis confirmed that 3D ZFL spheroids had greater transcriptional regulation of genes related to reproductive toxicological response and liver functions, such as the urea cycle, estrogen receptors, and vitellogenin, compared to monolayer cells. These results may contribute to the engineering of novel 3D in vitro platforms for screening harmful chemicals and improving understanding of the underlying liver toxicity mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels.","10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106105",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
2872,"Porcine Intestinal Apical-Out Organoid Model for Gut Function Study.; apical-out and barrier integrity and intestinal organoid and nutrient uptake and pig model; Pig models provide valuable research information on farm animals, veterinary, and biomedical sciences. Experimental pig gut models are used in studies on physiology, nutrition, and diseases. Intestinal organoids are powerful tools for investigating intestinal functions such as nutrient uptake and gut barrier function. However, organoids have a basal-out structure and need to grow in the extracellular matrix, which causes difficulties in research on the intestinal apical membrane. We established porcine intestinal organoids from jejunum tissues and developed basal-out and apical-out organoids using different sub-culture methods. Staining and quantitative real-time PCR showed the difference in axis change of the membrane and gene expression of epithelial cell marker genes. To consider the possibility of using apical-out organoids for intestinal function, studies involving fatty acid uptake and disruption of the epithelial barrier were undertaken. Fluorescence fatty acid was more readily absorbed in apical-out organoids than in basal-out organoids within the same time. To determine whether apical-out organoids form a functional barrier, a fluorescent dextran diffusion assay was performed. Hence, we successfully developed porcine intestinal organoid culture systems and showed that the porcine apical-out organoid model is ideal for the investigation of the intestinal environment. It can be used in future studies related to the intestine across various research fields.","10.3390/ani12030372",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
2896,"Evaluation of growth, viability, and structural integrity of equine endometrial organoids following cryopreservation.; 3D culture and Cryopreservation and Dimethyl sulfoxide and Endometrium and Equine and In vitro and Mare and Organoid and Uterus; Reproductive diseases in mares are a significant cause of subfertility and profound economic loss in the equine industry. Utilizing a 3D in vitro cell culture system that recapitulates the in vivo physiology will reduce time, cost, and welfare concerns associated with in vivo reproductive research in mares. If this 3D model is combined with effective cryopreservation, reproductive research on mares can occur year-round, which is not currently possible in this seasonal species. Endometrial organoids, 3D in vitro cell clusters that exhibit in vivo uterine physiology, have been established in mice, women, and mares. Here we report the first comprehensive assessment of cryopreservation of endometrial organoids in the domestic mare. Organoid growth rate was not affected by the type of freezing media. However, growth rate varied among non-cryopreserved controls, organoids cryopreserved at passage 0 (P0), and organoids cryopreserved at passage 3 (P3). Additionally, there was no difference in organoid viability among freezing media or freezing timepoint (passages). Furthermore, fresh and frozen-thawed organoids displayed positive immunohistochemical staining for ZO-1, which is a marker for intercellular tight junctions, and for periodic acid-Schiff staining as marker for organoid function through mucin production. Results demonstrate that equine endometrial organoids can be cryopreserved with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide with minimal detrimental effects while maintaining intercellular tight junctions (ZO-1) and secretory function. Availability of cryopreserved endometrial organoids may permit expanded research on uterine pathologies that negatively affect mare fertility and improve efficiency, reduce cost, and minimize animal welfare concerns associated with in vivo research in the domestic mare.","10.1016/j.cryobiol.2021.11.003",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Novel personalized medicine approaches tailored to each tumor are urgently needed to improve cancer treatment. Current pediatric precision oncology platforms, such as the INFORM (INdividualized Therapy FOr Relapsed Malignancies in Childhood) study, reveal that molecular profiling of tumor tissue identifies targets associated with clinical benefit in a subgroup of patients only and should be complemented with functional drug testing. In such an approach, patient-derived tumor cells are exposed to a library of approved oncological drugs in a physiological setting, e.g., in the form of animal avatars injected with patient tumor cells. We used molecularly fully characterized tumor samples from the INFORM study to compare drug screen results of individual patient-derived cell models in functional assays: (i) patient-derived spheroid cultures within a few days after tumor dissociation; (ii) tumor cells reisolated from the corresponding mouse PDX; (iii) corresponding long-term organoid-like cultures and (iv) drug evaluation with the corresponding zebrafish PDX (zPDX) model.

In this study, we explored the CTBP2/RIBEYE gene locus and its unique repertoire of transcripts that are conserved among vertebrates. We studied the transcriptional coregulator (CTBP2) and ribbon synapse-specific structural protein (RIBEYE) in the chicken retina by performing comprehensive histochemical and sequencing analyses to pinpoint cell and developmental stage-specific expression of CTBP2/RIBEYE in the developing chicken retina. We demonstrated that CTBP2 is widely expressed in retinal progenitors beginning in early retinogenesis but becomes limited to GABAergic amacrine cells in the mature retina. Inversely, RIBEYE is initially epigenetically silenced in progenitors and later expressed in photoreceptor and bipolar cells where they localize to ribbon synapses. Finally, we compared CTBP2/RIBEYE regulation in the developing human retina using a pluripotent stem cell derived retinal organoid culture system. These analyses demonstrate that similar regulation of the CTBP2/RIBEYE locus during chick and human retinal development is regulated by different members of the K50 homeodomain transcription factor family.","10.3389/fnmol.2021.773356",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Our rabbit intestinal spheroid and monolayer cultures grew most efficiently in L-WRN-conditioned medium that contained Wnt, R-spondin and Noggin, and that had been supplemented with ROCK and TGF- inhibitors. Organoid and monolayer differentiation was initiated by reducing the concentration of the L-WRN-conditioned medium and by adding ROCK and Notch signalling inhibitors.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the disrupted epithelial regeneration might provide an alternative approach for the treatment of HIV-mediated enteropathy and immune activation. We have observed a significant increased presence of alpha defensin5+ (HD5) Paneth cells and proliferating Ki67+ epithelial cells as well as decreased expression of E-cadherin expression in epithelial cells during SIV infection. SIV infection did not significantly influence the frequency of LGR5+ stem cells, but the frequency of HD5+ cells was significantly higher compared to uninfected controls in jejunum. Our global transcriptomics analysis of enteroids provided novel information about highly significant changes in several important pathways like metabolic, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, where the majority of the differentially expressed genes were downregulated in enteroids grown from chronically SIV-infected macaques compared to the SIV-uninfected controls. Despite the lack of significant reduction in LGR5+ stem cell population, the dysregulation of several intestinal stem cell niche factors including Notch, mTOR, AMPK and Wnt pathways as well as persistence of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and loss of epithelial barrier function in enteroids further supports that SIV infection impacts on epithelial cell proliferation and intestinal homeostasis.","10.3389/fimmu.2021.769990",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

3155,"P06-15 Intestinal organoids as in vitro model system to assess safety and ADME properties of compounds; NA; Introduction: Despite advances made in drug development, safety, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies are often performed using traditional models such as cell lines, primary tissues, or animals. However, these models poorly mimic human physiology leading to adverse effects in clinical trials and compounds' attrition. HUB OrganoidsTM are derived from adult stem cells from epithelial tissues including, but not limited to, the gastrointestinal tract. These organoid cultures have long-term expansion capacity, are genetically and phenotypically stable, and retain biological and functional properties of the original tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate human and animal intestinal organoids as an in vitro model for predicting pre-clinical safety. Methods and Results: Metabolic activity of human colonic and duodenal organoids was assessed by incubating HUB Organoids with substrates of Phase I and II enzymes. Metabolite formation detected by mass spectrometry showed, in both colon and duodenum organoids, metabolic activity for most Phase I enzymes, except CYP2J2 and CES2 with high activity, was low but detectable. The main phase II metabolizing enzymes were detected with high activity. To assess permeability and transport, epithelial monolayers derived from human duodenal organoids were incubated with test compounds. Bi-directional transport from apical to the basolateral compartment and vice versa was determined. As expected by comparison to human bioavailability data, atenolol was shown to be a low and propranolol, a high permeable compound. Transport of digoxin (p-Glycoprotein (P-gp)-substrate), and estrone-3-sulfate (Breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP)-substrate), in presence and absence of selective inhibitors of their respective efflux transporters, showed functional activity of the P-gp, and BCRP transporters. For Gastrointestinal toxicity (GIT) assays, human, rat, and dog colonic and duodenal organoids were seeded and treated with compounds having positive and negative GIT profiles followed by a cell viability assay. The toxicity data indicate that HUB Organoids can predict GIT comparable with clinical and pre-clinical in vivo data. Conclusion(s): Pre-clinical toxicity, metabolism, transport, and permeability assessment of compounds using HUB Organoids reduce costly traditional animal experiments and provide a quick indication of drug safety, allowing decision making at early stages of drug development.

Interactions between pathogens and epithelial cells at the mucosal surface play a key role in determining the outcome of GI infections; however, the inaccessibility of the GI tract in vivo significantly limits the ability to study such interactions in detail. We therefore developed ovine epithelial organoids representing physiologically important gastric and intestinal sites of infection, specifically the abomasum (analogous to the stomach in monogastrics) and ileum. We show that both abomasal and ileal organoids form self-organising three-dimensional structures with a single epithelial layer and a central lumen that are stable in culture over serial passage. We performed RNA-seq analysis on abomasal and ileal tissue from multiple animals and on organoids across multiple passages and show the transcript profile of both abomasal and ileal organoids cultured under identical conditions are reflective of the tissue from which they were derived and that the transcript profile in organoids is stable over at least five serial passages. In addition, we demonstrate that the organoids can be successfully cryopreserved and resuscitated, allowing long-term storage of organoid lines, thereby reducing the number of animals required as a source of tissue. We also report the first published observations of a helminth infecting gastric and intestinal organoids by challenge with the sheep parasitic nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta, demonstrating the utility of these organoids for pathogen co-culture experiments. Finally, the polarity in the abomasal and ileal organoids can be inverted to make the apical surface directly accessible to pathogens or their products, here shown by infection of apical-out organoids with the zoonotic enteric bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. In summary, we report a simple and reliable in vitro culture system for generation and maintenance of small ruminant intestinal and gastric organoids.

However, they are associated with several drawbacks that require resolution. Optimizing chondrocyte expansion and their assembly, can reduce the time and costs of these therapies and more importantly increase their clinical success. In this study, cartilage organoids were quickly mass produced from bovine chondrocytes with a new suspension expansion protocol. This new approach led to massive cell proliferation, high viability and the self-assembly of organoids. These organoids were composed of collagen type II, type VI, glycosaminoglycans, with Sox9 positive cells, embedded in a pericellular and interterritorial matrix similarly to hyaline cartilage. With the goal of producing large scale tissues, we then encapsulated these organoids into alginate hydrogels with different viscoelastic properties. Elastic hydrogels constrained the growth and fusion of the organoids inhibiting the formation of a tissue. In contrast, viscoelastic hydrogels allowed the growth and fusion of the organoids into a homogenous tissue that was rich in collagen type II and glycosaminoglycans. The encapsulation of organoids to produce in vitro neocartilage also proved to be superior to the conventional method of encapsulating 2D expanded chondrocytes. This study describes a multimodal approach that involves chondrocyte expansion, organoid formation and their assembly into neohyaline-cartilage which proved to be superior to the current standard approaches used in cartilage tissue engineering. Statement of significance: In this manuscript, we describe a new and simple methodology to quickly mass produce self-assembling cartilage organoids. Due to their matrix content and structure similarities with native cartilage, these organoids on their own have the potential to revolutionize cartilage research and the manner in which we study signaling pathways, disease progression, tissue engineering, drug development, etc. Furthermore, these organoids and their fast mass production were combined with a key relatively ignored hydrogel characteristic, viscoelasticity, to demonstrate their fusion into a neo-tissue.

3277,"Tissue-Specific Microparticles Improve Organoid Microenvironment for Efficient Maturation of Pluripotent Stem-Cell-Derived Hepatocytes.; hepatic differentiation and liver organoid and pluripotent stem cell and tissue engineering and tissue-specific microparticle; Liver organoids (LOs) are receiving considerable attention for their potential use in drug screening, disease modeling, and transplantable constructs. Hepatocytes, as the key component of LOs, are isolated from the liver or differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). PSC-derived hepatocytes are preferable because of their availability and scalability. However, efficient maturation of the PSC-derived hepatocytes towards functional units in LOs remains a challenging subject. The incorporation of cell-sized microparticles (MPs) derived from liver extracellular matrix (ECM), could provide an enriched tissue-specific microenvironment for further maturation of hepatocytes inside the LOs. In the present study, the MPs were fabricated by chemical cross-linking of a water-in-oil dispersion of digested decellularized sheep liver. These MPs were mixed with human PSC-derived hepatic endoderm, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells to produce homogenous bioengineered LOs (BLOs). This approach led to the improvement of hepatocyte-like cells in terms of gene expression and function, CYP activities, albumin secretion, and metabolism of xenobiotics. The intraperitoneal transplantation of BLOs in an acute liver injury mouse model led to an enhancement in survival rate. Furthermore, efficient hepatic maturation was demonstrated after ex ovo transplantation. In conclusion, the incorporation of cell-sized tissue-specific MPs in BLOs improved the maturation of human PSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells compared to LOs. This approach provides a versatile strategy to produce functional organoids from different tissues and offers a novel tool for biomedical applications.","10.3390/cells10061274",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3362,"Anti-tumor effect of trametinib in bladder cancer organoid and the underlying mechanism; NA; Bladder cancer (BC), a main neoplasm of urinary tract, is usually inoperable and unresponsive to chemotherapy. As a novel experimental model for muscle-invasive BC, we previously established a culture method of dog BC organoids. In the present study, the detailed in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects of trametinib were investigated by using this model. In each BC organoid strain, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERK signaling was upregulated compared with normal bladder cells. Trametinib even at a low concentration inhibited the cell viability of BC organoids and the activation of ERK through decreasing expression of c-Myc, ELK1, SIK1, and PLA2G4A. Trametinib arrested cell cycle of BC with few apoptosis. Dual treatment of BC organoids with trametinib and YAP inhibitor, verteporfin extremely inhibited the cell viability with apoptosis induction. Moreover, trametinib induced basal to luminal differentiation of BC organoids by upregulating luminal markers and downregulating basal ones. In vivo, trametinib decreased the tumor growth of BC organoids in mice and the xenograft-derived organoids from trametinib-administered mice showed enhanced sensitivity to carboplatin due to MSH2 upregulation. Our data suggested a new strategy of trametinib-YAP inhibitor or trametinib-carboplatin combination as a promising treatment of BC.","10.1080/15384047.2021.1919004",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3366,"TGF-beta loaded exosome enhances ischemic wound healing in vitro and in vivo; NA; Rationale: With over seven million infections and $25 billion treatment cost, chronic ischemic wounds are one of the most serious complications in the United States. The controlled release of bioactive factor enriched exosome from finbrin gel was a promising strategy to promote wound healing. Method(s): To address this unsolved problem, we developed clinical-grade platelets exosome product (PEP), which was incorporate with injectable surgical fibrin sealant (TISSEEL), to promote chronic wound healing and complete skin regeneration. The PEP characterization stimulated cellular activities and in vivo rabbit ischemic wound healing capacity of TISSEEL-PEP were performed and analyzed. Result(s): PEP, enriched with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), possessed exosomal characteristics including exosome size, morphology, and typical markers including CD63, CD9, and ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix). In vitro, PEP significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, as well as skin organoid formation. Topical treatment of ischemic wounds with TISSEEL-PEP promoted full-thickness healing with the reacquisition of hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Superior to untreated and TISSEEL-only treated controls, TISSEEL-PEP drove cutaneous healing associated with collagen synthesis and restoration of dermal architecture. Furthermore, PEP promoted epithelial and vascular cell activity enhancing angiogenesis to restore blood flow and mature skin function. Transcriptome deconvolution of TISSEEL-PEP versus TISSEEL-only treated wounds prioritized regenerative pathways encompassing neovascularization, matrix remodeling and tissue growth. Conclusion(s): This room-temperature stable, lyophilized exosome product is thus capable of delivering a bioactive transforming growth factor beta to drive regenerative events.","10.7150/thno.57701",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3408,"Validation of Immunohistochemistry for Canine Proteins Involved in Thyroid Iodine Uptake and Their Expression in Canine Follicular Cell Thyroid Carcinomas (FTCs) and FTC-Derived Organoids; dogs;  endocrine gland neoplasms;  immunohistochemistry;  iodine metabolism;  organoids;  thyroid carcinoma;  thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor;  western blot; Thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), sodium iodide symporter (NIS), pendrin, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) are essential for the uptake of iodine by follicular thyroid cells. The aim of this study was to establish immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols for TSHR, NIS, pendrin, and TPO in canine tissues and characterize their expression in organoids derived from canine follicular cell thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and in the respective primary tumors. This constitutes a fundamental step to establish organoids as a model to study the uptake of iodine in canine FTC. Commercially available antibodies directed against human proteins were selected. Antibody specificity was confirmed by western blot using lysates of the HTori-3 human thyroid cell line and healthy canine thyroid gland. IHC was validated using HTori-3 cells and a set of canine normal tissues including healthy thyroid gland. The expression of TSHR, NIS, pendrin, and TPO was evaluated in 3 organoid lines derived from FTC and respective primary tumors. All 4 antibodies produced specific bands by western blot and cytoplasmic labeling in follicular cells by IHC in both human HTori-3 cells and canine thyroid gland. NIS also showed basolateral membrane immunolabeling in follicular cells. All 4 proteins were highly expressed in organoids derived from FTC. The expression was similar or higher compared to the primary tumors. The results of this study characterize organoids derived from canine FTC as a suitable in vitro model to investigate iodine uptake, opening new research possibilities in the field of canine thyroid cancer therapy.

3448,"High-precision targeting workflow for volume electron microscopy.; NA; Cells are 3D objects. Therefore, volume EM (vEM) is often crucial for correct interpretation of ultrastructural data. Today, scanning EM (SEM) methods such as focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM are frequently used for vEM analyses. While they allow automated data acquisition, precise targeting of volumes of interest within a large sample remains challenging. Here, we provide a workflow to target FIB-SEM acquisition of fluorescently labeled cells or subcellular structures with micrometer precision. The strategy relies on fluorescence preservation during sample preparation and targeted trimming guided by confocal maps of the fluorescence signal in the resin block. Laser branding is used to create landmarks on the block surface to position the FIB-SEM acquisition. Using this method, we acquired volumes of specific single cells within large tissues such as 3D cultures of mouse mammary gland organoids, tracheal terminal cells in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, and ovarian follicular cells in adult Drosophila, discovering ultrastructural details that could not be appreciated before.","10.1083/jcb.202104069",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

We investigated the tropism and innate host responses of 5 recent HPAI A(H5N6/ H5N8) avian isolates of clades 2.3.4.4b, e, and h in human airway organoids and primary human alveolar epithelial cells. The HPAI A(H5N6/H5N8) avian isolates replicated productively but with lower competence than the infl uenza A(H1N1)pdm09, HPAI A(H5N1), and HPAI A(H5N6) isolates from humans in both or either models. They showed diff erential cellular tropism in human airway organoids; some infected all 4 major epithelial cell types: Ciliated cells, club cells, goblet cells, and basal cells.

Organoids have been shown to be promising models for drug test as they reasonably preserve tissue structure and functions. However, colonic organoids of pig and monkey are not yet established. Here, we report a culture medium to support the growth of porcine and monkey colonic organoids. Wnt signaling and PGE2 are important for long-term expansion of the organoids, and their withdrawal results in lineage differentiation to mature cells. Furthermore, we observe that porcine colonic organoids are closer to human colonic organoids in terms of drug toxicity response. Successful establishment of porcine and monkey colonic organoids would facilitate the mechanistic investigation of the homeostatic regulation of the intestine of these animals and is useful for drug development and toxicity studies.","10.1186/s13619-021-00094-4",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3524,"Dietary Copper Improves Intestinal Morphology via Modulating Intestinal Stem Cell Activity in Pigs.; cell proliferation and copper and intestinal morphology and intestinal stem cell and pig; Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for animals. Many studies have been conducted on the effects of dietary Cu on growth performance, intestinal morphology, and function of piglets. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be explored. Intestinal stem cells (ISC) drive the development and constant renewal of intestinal epithelium. Therefore, we hypothesized that dietary Cu affects piglets' intestinal development via modulating ISC activity. A total of eighty-five 21-day-old piglets were randomly assigned to five groups, where 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 mg CuSO(4)/kg on a dry matter basis were supplemented to the basal diet at phase 1 (day 0 to 21). Increasing the dietary Cu concentration decreased (p < 0.05) villus width but increased (p < 0.001) the number of Ki67-positive cells. At phase 2 (day 22 to 163), the other 45 pigs were offered the same diets. Villus height in the 125 mg/kg Cu group was greater (p < 0.001) than in the other groups. Moreover, the effects of Cu on ISC activity in vitro were tested to explore the underlying mechanism. Compared to the control group, 10 mol/L CuSO(4)5H(2)O increased (p < 0.001) the organoid budding efficiency, crypt depth, and crypts per organoid.

3540,"Generation of equine enteroids and enteroid-derived 2D monolayers that are responsive to microbial mimics.; 2D monolayer and Enteroid and Enteroid-derived and Epithelium and Equine and In vitro and Intestine and TLR; Enteroid cultures are three-dimensional in vitro models that reflect the cellular composition and architecture of the small intestine. One limitation with the enteroid conformation is the enclosed lumen, making it difficult to expose the apical surface of the epithelium to experimental treatments. The present study was therefore conducted to generate cultures of equine enteroids and to develop methods for culture of enteroid-derived cells on a two-dimensional plane, enabling easy access to the apical surface of the epithelium. Equine enteroids were established from small intestinal crypts within 7-9 days of culture. Transcriptional analysis of cell type markers confirmed the presence of enterocytes, stem-, Paneth-, proliferative-, enteroendocrine-, goblet- and tuft cells. This cellular composition was maintained over multiple passages, showing that the enteroids can be kept for prolonged periods. The transfer from 3D enteroids to 2D monolayers slightly modified the relative expression levels of the cell type markers, indicating a decrease of goblet- and Paneth cells in the monolayers. Stimulation with the TLR2, 3 and 4 agonists Pam3CSK4, Poly I:C and LPS, respectively, induced the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-8, while the TLR5 agonist FliC only induced TNF-. In addition, an up-regulation of TGF-, IL-33 and IFN- was recorded after exposure to lipofected Poly I:C that also affected the monolayer integrity. Thus, the equine enteroid-derived 2D monolayers described in the present study show both genetic and functional similarities with the equine intestine making it an interesting in vitro model for studies demanding access to the apical surface, e.g. in studies of host-microbe interactions.","10.1186/s13567-021-00976-0",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3558,"Chick fetal organ spheroids as a model to study development and disease.; 3D cell culture and Cancer and Chick and Development and Fetal organ spheroids and Invasion; BACKGROUND: Organ culture models have been used over the past few decades to study development and disease. The in vitro three-dimensional (3D) culture system of organoids is well known, however, these 3D systems are both costly and difficult to culture and maintain. As such, less expensive, faster and less complex methods to maintain 3D cell culture models would complement the use of organoids. Chick embryos have been used as a model to study human biology for centuries, with many fundamental discoveries as a result. These include cell type induction, cell competence, plasticity and contact inhibition, which indicates the relevance of using chick embryos when studying developmental biology and disease mechanisms. RESULTS: Here, we present an updated protocol that enables time efficient, cost effective and long-term expansion of fetal organ spheroids (FOSs) from chick embryos. Utilizing this protocol, we generated FOSs in an anchorage-independent growth pattern from seven different organs, including brain, lung, heart, liver, stomach, intestine and epidermis. These three-dimensional (3D) structures recapitulate many cellular and structural aspects of their in vivo counterpart organs and serve as a useful developmental model. In addition, we show a functional application of FOSs to analyze cell-cell interaction and cell invasion patterns as observed in cancer. CONCLUSION: The establishment of a broad ranging and highly effective method to generate FOSs from different organs was successful in terms of the formation of healthy, proliferating 3D organ spheroids that exhibited organ-like characteristics. Potential applications of chick FOSs are their use in studies of cell-to-cell contact, cell fusion and tumor invasion under defined conditions. Future studies will reveal whether chick FOSs also can be applicable in scientific areas such as viral infections, drug screening, cancer diagnostics and/or tissue engineering.","10.1186/s12860-021-00374-6",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

However, very limited studies are available on the functional characterisation and three-dimensional (3D) expansion of adult stem cells in livestock species compared to other species. Intestinal crypts derived from intestinal organoids under a 3D culture system from the small intestine in adult bovine were successfully established and characterised for functionality testing, including the cellular potentials and genetic properties based on immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, epithelial barrier permeability assay, QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq. data and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Intestinal organoids were long-term cultivated over several passages of culture without loss of the recapitulating capacity of crypts, and they had the specific expression of several specific markers involved in intestinal stem cells, intestinal epithelium, and nutrient absorption. In addition, they showed the key functionality with regard to a high permeability for compounds of up to FITC-dextran 4 kDa, while FITC-dextran 40 kDa failed to enter the organoid lumen and revealed that the genetic properties of bovine intestinal organoids were highly similar to those of in vivo. Collectively, these results provide a reliable method for efficient isolation of intestinal crypts from the small intestine and robust 3D expansion of intestinal organoids in adult bovine and demonstrate the in vitro 3D organoids mimics the in vivo tissue topology and functionality. Finally, intestinal organoids are potential alternatives to in vivo systems and will be facilitated as the practical model to replace animal experiments for various purposes in the fields of animal biotechnology.","10.3390/ani11072115",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3621,"Heat-stable enterotoxin inhibits intestinal stem cell expansion to disrupt the intestinal integrity by downregulating the Wnt/-catenin pathway.; STp and Wnt/-catenin signaling and enteroid and intestinal stem cell and spheroids; Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli causes severe infectious diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality in newborn and weanling pigs mainly through the production of heat-stable enterotoxins (STs). However, the precise regulatory mechanisms involved in ST-induced intestinal epithelium injury remain unclear. Consequently, we conducted the experiments invivo (mice), exvivo (mouse and porcine enteroids), and invitro (MODE-K and IPEC-J2 cells) to explore the effect of STp (one type of STa) on the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. The results showed that acute STp exposure led to small intestinal edema, disrupted intestinal integrity, induced crypt cell expansion into spheroids, and downregulated Wnt/-catenin activity in the mice. Following a similar trend, the enteroid-budding efficiency and the expression of Active -catenin, -catenin, Lgr5, PCNA, and KRT20 were significantly decreased after STp treatment, as determined exvivo. In addition, STp inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, destroyed cell barriers, and reduced Wnt/-catenin activity by downregulating its membrane receptor Frizzled7 (FZD7). In contrast, Wnt/-catenin reactivation protected the IPEC-J2 cells from STp-induced injury. Taking these findings together, we conclude that STp inhibits intestinal stem cell expansion to disrupt the integrity of the intestinal mucosa through the downregulation of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway.","10.1002/stem.3324",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

3646,"Porcine small intestinal organoids as a model to explore ETEC-host interactions in the gut; NA; Small intestinal organoids, or enteroids, represent a valuable model to study host-pathogen interactions at the intestinal epithelial surface. Much research has been done on murine and human enteroids, however only a handful studies evaluated the development of enteroids in other species. Porcine enteroid cultures have been described, but little is known about their functional responses to specific pathogens or their associated virulence factors. Here, we report that porcine enteroids respond in a similar manner as in vivo gut tissues to enterotoxins derived from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, an enteric pathogen causing postweaning diarrhoea in piglets. Upon enterotoxin stimulation, these enteroids not only display a dysregulated electrolyte and water balance as shown by their swelling, but also secrete inflammation markers. Porcine enteroids grown as a 2D-monolayer supported the adhesion of an F4+ ETEC strain. Hence, these enteroids closely mimic in vivo intestinal epithelial responses to gut pathogens and are a promising model to study host-pathogen interactions in the pig gut.

3664,"Autonomous Calcium Signaling in Human and Zebrafish Podocytes Controls Kidney Filtration Barrier Morphogenesis.; calcium signaling and glomerulus and kidney organoid and organoid glomeruli and podocyte and zebrafish; BACKGROUND: Podocytes are critical to maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier, and mutations in nephrotic syndrome genes are known to affect podocyte calcium signaling. However, the role of calcium signaling during podocyte development remains unknown. METHODS: We undertook live imaging of calcium signaling in developing podocytes, using zebrafish larvae and human kidney organoids. To evaluate calcium signaling during development and in response to channel blockers and genetic defects, the calcium biosensor GCaMP6s was expressed in zebrafish podocytes. We used electron microscopy to evaluate filtration barrier formation in zebrafish, and Fluo-4 to detect calcium signals in differentiating podocytes in human kidney organoids. RESULTS: Immature zebrafish podocytes (2.5 days postfertilization) generated calcium transients that correlated with interactions with forming glomerular capillaries. Calcium transients persisted until 4 days postfertilization, and were absent after glomerular barrier formation was complete. We detected similar calcium transients in maturing human organoid glomeruli, suggesting a conserved mechanism. In both models, inhibitors of SERCA or IP3 receptor calcium-release channels blocked calcium transients in podocytes, whereas lanthanum was ineffective, indicating the calcium source is from intracellular podocyte endoplasmic-reticulum stores. Calcium transients were not affected by blocking heartbeat or by blocking development of endothelium or endoderm, and they persisted in isolated glomeruli, suggesting podocyte-autonomous calcium release. Inhibition of expression of phospholipase C-1, but not nephrin or phospholipase C-1, led to significantly decreased calcium activity. Finally, blocking calcium release affected glomerular shape and podocyte foot process formation, supporting the critical role of calcium signaling in glomerular morphogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish podocyte cell-autonomous calcium signaling as a prominent and evolutionarily conserved feature of podocyte differentiation and demonstrate its requirement for podocyte foot process formation.","10.1681/asn.2020101525",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

However, snake venom is also a rich source of bioactive molecules with known or potential therapeutic applications. Manually 'milking' snakes is the most common method to obtain venom. Safer alternative methods to produce venom would facilitate the production of both antivenom and novel therapeutics. This protocol describes the generation, maintenance and selected applications of snake venom gland organoids. Snake venom gland organoids are 3D culture models that can be derived within days from embryonic or adult venom gland tissues from several snake species and can be maintained long-term (we have cultured some organoids for more than 2 years). We have successfully used the protocol with glands from late-stage embryos and recently deceased adult snakes. The cellular heterogeneity of the venom gland is maintained in the organoids, and cell type composition can be controlled through changes in media composition. We describe in detail how to derive and grow the organoids, how to dissociate them into single cells, and how to cryopreserve and differentiate them into toxin-producing organoids. We also provide guidance on useful downstream assays, specifically quantitative real-time PCR, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and genetic engineering. This stepwise protocol can be performed in any laboratory with tissue culture equipment and enables studies of venom production, differentiation and cellular heterogeneity.","10.1038/s41596-020-00463-4",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"yes"

Therefore, a suitable model for studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for neurological diseases that can appropriately mimic the human brain is needed. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) was performed using an established porcine Yucatan EGFP cell line and whole seeding was performed using SCNT blastocysts.

3828,"Thymosin 4 dynamics during chicken enteroid development.; Immunohistochemistry and Intestinal enteroids and Thymosin 4 and Wound healing; The sheared avian intestinal villus-crypts exhibit high tendency to self-repair and develop enteroids in culture. Presuming that this transition process involves differential biomolecular changes, we employed matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to find whether there were differences in the spectral profiles of sheared villi versus the enteroids, assessed in the mass range of 2-18 kDa. The results showed substantial differences in the intensities of the spectral peaks, one particularly corresponding to the mass of 4963 Da, which was significantly low in the sheared villus-crypts compared with the enteroids. Based on our previous results with other avian tissues and further molecular characterization by LC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), the peak was identified to be thymosin 4 (T4), a ubiquitously occurring regulatory peptide implicated in wound healing process. The identity of the peptide was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry which showed it to be present in a very low levels in the sheared villi but replete in the enteroids. Since T4 sequesters G-actin preventing its polymerization to F-actin, we compared the changes in F-actin by its immunohistochemical localization that showed no significant differences between the sheared villi and enteroids. We propose that depletion of T4 likely precedes villous reparation process. The possible mechanism for the differences in T4 profile in relation to the healing of the villus-crypts to developing enteroids is discussed.","10.1007/s11010-020-04008-x",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

SSTorg were cultured for 24 h and added to live (LV), frozen (FZ) and lysed (LY) avian sperm, seminal plasma (SP), avian sperm conditioned medium (CM), or bovine sperm (BV). Western blot demonstrated that SSTorg contained EV protein markers, valosin-containing protein (VCP), heat shock proteins (HSP90AA1, HSPA8), and annexins (ANXA2, A4, A5). Co-culture with LV significantly decreased the intracellular level of all these proteins except HSPA8. Immunohistochemistry confirmed this result for VCP and ANXA4. LY, CM, SP and BV had no effect on the intracellular level of these proteins, whereas FZ induced a decrease in ANXA2, A4 and A5. In culture media, VCP and HSP90AA1 signals were detected in the presence of LV, FZ, BV, LY, CM and SP, but no ANXA4 signal was observed in the presence of FZ and SP. ANXA2 and A5 were only detected in the presence of LV. The most abundant EV were less than 150 nm in diameter. ANXA4 and A5 were more abundant in EV isolated from the SSTorg culture medium. This study provides a useful culture system for studying interactions between SST cells and sperm. We demonstrated the release of EV by SSTorg in vitro, and its regulation by sperm.

Due to their multicellular composition, organoids offer advantages over traditionally used immortalized or primary cell lines. However, organoids must be accurate models of their tissues of origin. This study compared gene expression profiles with respect to markers of specific cell types (stem cells, enterocytes, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells) and barrier maturation (tight junctions) of colonoid and enteroid cultures with their tissues of origin and colonoids with enteroids. Colonoids derived from three healthy pigs formed multilobed structures with a monolayer of cells similar to the crypt structures in colonic tissue. Colonoid and enteroid gene expression signatures were more similar to those found for the tissues of their origin than to each other. However, relative to their derived tissues, organoids had increased gene expression levels of stem cell markers Sox9 and Lgr5 encoding sex-determining region Y-box 9 and leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled rector 5, respectively. In contrast, expression levels of Occl and Zo1 encoding occludin and zonula occludens 1, respectively, were decreased. Expression levels of the cell lineage markers Atoh1, Cga, and Muc2 encoding atonal homolog 1, chromogranin A, and mucin 2, respectively, were decreased in colonoids, whereas Sglt1 and Apn encoding sodium-glucose transporter 1 and aminopeptidase A, respectively, were decreased in enteroids. These results indicate colonoid and enteroid cultures were predominantly comprised of undifferentiated cell types with decreased barrier maturation relative to their tissues of origin.

Cultured explants of the Xenopus dorsal marginal zone (""Keller"" explants) serve as a central paradigm for studies of convergent extension cell movements, yet we know little about the global patterns of gene expression in these explants. RESULTS: In an effort to more thoroughly develop this important model system, we provide here a time-resolved bulk transcriptome for developing Keller explants. CONCLUSIONS: The dataset reported here provides a useful resource for those using Keller explants for studies of morphogenesis and provide genome-scale insights into the temporal patterns of gene expression in an important tissue when explanted and grown in culture.","10.1002/dvdy.289",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3922,"Primate cell fusion disentangles gene regulatory divergence in neurodevelopment.; NA; Among primates, humans display a unique trajectory of development that is responsible for the many traits specific to our species. However, the inaccessibility of primary human and chimpanzee tissues has limited our ability to study human evolution. Comparative in vitro approaches using primate-derived induced pluripotent stem cells have begun to reveal species differences on the cellular and molecular levels(1,2). In particular, brain organoids have emerged as a promising platform to study primate neural development in vitro(3-5), although cross-species comparisons of organoids are complicated by differences in developmental timing and variability of differentiation(6,7). Here we develop a new platform to address these limitations by fusing human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells to generate a panel of tetraploid hybrid stem cells. We applied this approach to study species divergence in cerebral cortical development by differentiating these cells into neural organoids. We found that hybrid organoids provide a controlled system for disentangling cis- and trans-acting gene-expression divergence across cell types and developmental stages, revealing a signature of selection on astrocyte-related genes. In addition, we identified an upregulation of the human somatostatin receptor 2 gene (SSTR2), which regulates neuronal calcium signalling and is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders(8,9). We reveal a human-specific response to modulation of SSTR2 function in cortical neurons, underscoring the potential of this platform for elucidating the molecular basis of human evolution.","10.1038/s41586-021-03343-3",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

However, the sample preparations for such imaging are often onerous, and their capability for antigen detection is limited. Here, we describe FLASH (fast light-microscopic analysis of antibody-stained whole organs), a simple, rapid, fully customizable technique for molecular phenotyping of intact tissue volumes. FLASH utilizes non-degradative epitope recovery and membrane solubilization to enable the detection of a multitude of membranous, cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens in whole mouse organs and embryos, human biopsies, organoids and Drosophila. Retrieval and immunolabeling of epithelial markers, an obstacle for previous clearing techniques, can be achieved with FLASH. Upon volumetric imaging, FLASH-processed samples preserve their architecture and integrity and can be paraffin-embedded for subsequent histopathological analysis.

3932,"An early cell shape transition drives evolutionary expansion of the human forebrain.; ZEB2 and brain and brain expansion and cell shape and chimpanzee and evolution and gorilla and neural stem cells and neuroepithelium and organoids; The human brain has undergone rapid expansion since humans diverged from other great apes, but the mechanism of this human-specific enlargement is still unknown. Here, we use cerebral organoids derived from human, gorilla, and chimpanzee cells to study developmental mechanisms driving evolutionary brain expansion. We find that neuroepithelial differentiation is a protracted process in apes, involving a previously unrecognized transition state characterized by a change in cell shape. Furthermore, we show that human organoids are larger due to a delay in this transition, associated with differences in interkinetic nuclear migration and cell cycle length. Comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals differences in expression dynamics of cell morphogenesis factors, including ZEB2, a known epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator. We show that ZEB2 promotes neuroepithelial transition, and its manipulation and downstream signaling leads to acquisition of nonhuman ape architecture in the human context and vice versa, establishing an important role for neuroepithelial cell shape in human brain expansion.","10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.050",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3942,"Generation of intestinal chemosensory cells from nonhuman primate organoids.; Chemosensory and Intestine and Organoid and Primate; Several gastrointestinal epithelial cells are involved in taste signal transduction. Although rodent tissues are extensively used as a human gut model, recent studies show that the chemical sensing system in rodents differs from that in humans. Nonhuman primates in biomedical research are valuable animal models to advance our understanding of biological responses in humans. The 3D organoid culture produces functional gastrointestinal epithelial cells in vitro and can be generated from animal and human tissues. Here, we report the generation of intestinal chemosensory cells from nonhuman primates, macaques, using an organoid culture system. We were able to maintain macaque intestinal organoids in the proliferation medium for more than six months. Upon switching to differentiation medium, we observed a drastic change in organoid morphology and chemosensory cell marker protein expression. This switch from proliferation to differentiation was confirmed by transcriptome analysis of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum organoids. We further observed that the supplementation of culture media with interleukin (IL)-4 or the Notch inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ) accelerated terminal cell differentiation into chemosensory cells. Overall, we generated monkey intestinal organoids for the first time. These organoids are suitable for studying the function of primate chemosensory cells.","10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.12.044",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

OBJECTIVES: To optimize the canine keratinocyte organoid system and produce organoids that are structurally equivalent to in vivo canine epidermis, in order to enable studies that focus on epidermal diseases and diseases resulting from an impaired epidermal barrier. ANIMALS: Skin biopsies were obtained from five recently euthanized dogs of different breeds with no skin abnormalities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cells derived from microdissected interfollicular epidermis were seeded in basement membrane extract and epidermal organoids were grown under different media conditions. Organoids were characterized to assess cell morphology and architecture in haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and expression of selected epidermal markers (keratin 5, keratin 10, loricrin and filaggrin) by immunohistochemical analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: The selected epidermal markers were expressed in the same epidermal layers in the organoids cultured in expansion medium and differentiation medium as in normal interfollicular epidermis, yet restriction to the distinct layers was best achieved with expansion medium. Comparison of the mRNA expression levels of these markers revealed that relative expression is similar in organoids cultured in expansion medium and normal canine epidermis, while it differs in organoids cultured in differentiation medium. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Organoids cultured in expansion medium have an equivalent structure to the interfollicular epidermis and express key marker proteins in similar proportions. Epidermal organoids are therefore a promising in vitro model to study epidermal structure, function and dysfunction.","10.1111/vde.12914",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
3971,"Infection of porcine small intestinal enteroids with human and pig rotavirus A strains reveals contrasting roles for histo-blood group antigens and terminal sialic acids.; NA; Rotaviruses (RVs) are a leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in young children and livestock worldwide. Growing evidence suggests that host cellular glycans, such as histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and sialic acids (SA), are recognized by the RV surface protein VP4. However, a mechanistic understanding of these interactions and their effects on RV infection and pathogenesis is lacking. Here, we established a porcine crypt-derived 3D intestinal enteroids (PIEs) culture system which contains all intestinal epithelial cells identified in vivo and represents a unique physiologically functional model to study RV-glycan interactions in vitro. PIEs expressing different HBGAs (A+, H+, and A+/H+) were established and isolation, propagation, differentiation and RV infection conditions were optimized. Differentiated PIEs were infected with human RV (HRV) G1P[8] Wa, porcine RV (PRV) G9P[13], PRV Gottfried G4P[6] or PRV OSU G5P[7] virulent and attenuated strains and virus replication was measured by qRT-PCR. Our results indicated that virulent HRV G1P[8] Wa replicated to the highest titers in A+ PIEs, while a distinct trend was observed for PRV G9P[13] or G5P[7] with highest titers in H+ PIEs. Attenuated Wa and Gottfried strains replicated poorly in PIEs while the replication of attenuated G9P[13] and OSU strains in PIEs was relatively efficient. However, the replication of all 4 attenuate strains was less affected by the PIE HBGA phenotypes. HBGA synthesis inhibitor 2-F-Peracetyl-Fucose (2F) treatment demonstrated that HBGAs are essential for G1P[8] Wa replication; however, they may only serve as a cofactor for PRVs G9P[13] and OSU G5P[7]. Interestingly, contrasting outcomes were observed following sialidase treatment which significantly enhanced G9P[13] replication, but inhibited the growth of G5P[7]. These observations suggest that some additional receptors recognized by G9P[13] become unmasked after removal of terminal SA. Overall, our results confirm that differential HBGAs-RV and SA-RV interactions determine replication efficacy of virulent group A RVs in PIEs. Consequently, targeting individual glycans for development of therapeutics may not yield uniform results for various RV strains.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1009237",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Although OA is an incurable degenerative disease, several dietary supplements may help improve OA outcomes. In this study, we investigated the effects of Dielen() hydrolyzed fish collagens from skin (Promerim()30 and Promerim()60) and cartilage (Promerim()40) to analyze the phenotype and metabolism of equine articular chondrocytes (eACs) cultured as organoids. Here, our findings demonstrated the absence of cytotoxicity and the beneficial effect of Promerim() hydrolysates on eAC metabolic activity under physioxia; further, Promerim()30 also delayed eAC senescence. To assess the effect of Promerim() in a cartilage-like tissue, eACs were cultured as organoids under hypoxia with or without BMP-2 and/or IL-1. In some instances, alone or in the presence of IL-1, Promerim()30 and Promerim()40 increased protein synthesis of collagen types I and II, while decreasing transcript levels of proteases involved in OA pathogenesis, namely Htra1, and the metalloproteinases Mmp1-3, Adamts5, and Cox2. Both Promerim() hydrolysates also decreased Htra1 protein amounts, particularly in inflammatory conditions. The effect of Promerim() was enhanced under inflammatory conditions, possibly due to a decrease in the synthesis of inflammation-associated molecules. Finally, Promerim() favored in vitro repair in a scratch wound assay through an increase in cell proliferation or migration. Altogether, these data show that Promerim()30 and 40 hold promise as dietary supplements to relieve OA symptoms in patients and to delay OA progression.","10.3390/ijms22020580",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Previous studies in the newborn CF pig demonstrated decreased bile flow into the small intestine and a microgallbladder with increased luminal mucus and fluid secretion defects. In this study, we examined the intrahepatic bile ducts of the newborn CF pig. We assessed whether our findings from the gallbladder are present elsewhere in the porcine biliary tract and if CF pig cholangiocytes have fluid secretion defects. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated apical CFTR expression in non-CF pig intrahepatic bile ducts of a variety of sizes; CF pig intrahepatic bile ducts lacked CFTR expression. Assessment of serum markers did not reveal significant signs of hepatobiliary disease except for an elevation in direct bilirubin. Quantitative histology demonstrated that CF pigs had smaller bile ducts that more frequently contained luminal mucus. CF intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids were smaller and lacked cAMP-mediated fluid secretion. Together these data suggest that cholangiocyte fluid secretion is decreased in the CF pig, contributing to structural changes in bile ducts and decreased biliary flow.","10.14814/phy2.14978",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4119,"Pairing of segmentation clock genes drives robust pattern formation.; NA; Gene expression is an inherently stochastic process(1,2); however, organismal development and homeostasis require cells to coordinate the spatiotemporal expression of large sets of genes. In metazoans, pairs of co-expressed genes often reside in the same chromosomal neighbourhood, with gene pairs representing 10 to 50% of all genes, depending on the species(3-6). Because shared upstream regulators can ensure correlated gene expression, the selective advantage of maintaining adjacent gene pairs remains unknown(6). Here, using two linked zebrafish segmentation clock genes, her1 and her7, and combining single-cell transcript counting, genetic engineering, real-time imaging and computational modelling, we show that gene pairing boosts correlated transcription and provides phenotypic robustness for the formation of developmental patterns. Our results demonstrate that the prevention of gene pairing disrupts oscillations and segmentation, and the linkage of her1 and her7 is essential for the development of the body axis in zebrafish embryos. We predict that gene pairing may be similarly advantageous in other organisms, and our findings could lead to the engineering of precise synthetic clocks in embryos and organoids.","10.1038/s41586-020-03055-0",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4125,"HUB OrganoidsTM improve pre-clinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacokinetic studies for drug discovery and development; NA; Drug safety assessment at the preclinical stage is hampered by a lack of in vitro model systems that recapitulate healthy tissue physiology and gene expression for the evaluation of on- and off-target effects, drug metabolism, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Available cell line models are transformed to withstand in vitro culture and therefore do not represent normal tissue physiology and often do not express relevant enzymes and transporters. On the other hand, primary model systems have limited availability, expansion capacity, and are not stable in culture for experimental testing. Last but not least, pre-clinical studies using animal model are not always translatable to humans. Therefore there remains a need for advanced in vitro models to address drug toxicology, metabolism, and PK. HUB Organoids are innovative ""mini-organs in a dish"" derived from adult stem cells within epithelial organs - such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract organs - which form tissue-like structures resembling the parental organ histology and physiology. HUB Organoids are genetically and phenotypically stable in culture and retain the biological and functional properties of the original tissue and therefore simulate their responses to external stimuli. HUB Organoids can be scaled up as necessary for high-throughput screening and thus provide a unique and robust in vitro model for drug development, screening, and toxicology studies. The application of HUB Organoids from the GI tract of human, dog, and rat to safety studies using compounds with positive and negative GI toxicity profiles was evaluated. All four positive compounds were determined to be positive using human organoids, wherease for the two negative compounds high IC50's were observed. In addition, known interspecies as well as regional (colon vs duodenum) toxicity differences were detected. Next to GI organoids, we demonstrated that human liver organoids differentiated towards hepatocytes can be used for toxicity and metabolism assessment. Functionality of multiple CYP enzymes was detected in liver organoids, with CYP3A4 activity level comparable to that of primary hepatocytes (PHs). In addition, toxicity of 12 different compounds show a similar trend compared to PHs and HepG2 cells. Moreover, hepatoxicity of Fialuri-dine, which cannot be detected with other pre-clinical models, was also observed after long-term exposure. Altogether, our data indicate that HUB Organoids can predict toxicity of test compounds and can differentiate interspecies and regional toxicity differences as expected from in vivo studies. In addition, hepatotoxicity and metabolism in human liver organoids indicate differentiated human liver organoids are promising models to study drug-induced liver injury and drug metabolism. Therefore, HUB Organoids can serve as a model system in drug development and improve processes such as screening, and evaluation of transport, permeability, metabolism, and toxicity resulting in reduced cost and time.","10.1016/s0378-4274%2821%2900534-8",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

However, pancreatic Rest knockout mice failed to show abnormal numbers of endocrine cells, suggesting that REST is not a major regulator of endocrine differentiation. Using a different conditional allele that enables profound REST inactivation, we observed a marked increase in pancreatic endocrine cell formation. REST inhibition also promoted endocrinogenesis in zebrafish and mouse early postnatal ducts and induced -cell-specific genes in human adult duct-derived organoids. We also defined genomic sites that are bound and repressed by REST in the embryonic pancreas.

Recently, we demonstrated that phenotypic evolution can be impacted by early developmental events starting from the production of oocytes in the fish ovaries. A. mexicanus offers an amenable model to test the influence of maternal determinants on cell fate decisions during early development, yet the mechanisms by which the information contained in the eggs is translated into specific developmental programs remain obscure due to the lack of specific tools in this emergent model. Here we describe methods for the generation of pescoids from yolkless-blastoderm explants to test the influence of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues on cell fate decisions, as well as the production of chimeric embryos obtained by intermorph cell transplantations to probe cell autonomous or non-autonomous processes. We show that Astyanax pescoids have the potential to recapitulate the main ontogenetic events observed in intact embryos, including the internalization of mesodermal progenitors and eye development, as followed with zic:GFP reporter lines. In addition, intermorph cell grafts resulted in proper integration of exogenous cells into the embryonic tissues, with lineages becoming more restricted from mid-blastula to gastrula.

Here, we present a versatile light-sheet imaging instrument that combines two independently controlled microscope-twins, built so that they can share an ultrafast near-infrared laser and a bank of continuous-wave visible lasers, increasing the throughput and decreasing the cost.

4246,"Next-Generation Porcine Intestinal Organoids: an Apical-Out Organoid Model for Swine Enteric Virus Infection and Immune Response Investigations.; TGEV and apical-out and crypt cell and intestinal organoids and pigs; The intestinal organoid culture system is a pathbreaking working model for investigating pathogen-host interactions in the intestines. However, due to the limitations of the first generation of intestinal organoids, basal-out structure and growth in Matrigel, most pathogens can rarely attach to the apical membrane directly and hardly initiate infection. In this study, we first developed a next-generation porcine intestinal organoid culture system, characterized by an apical membrane on the surface, called apical-out. To investigate the infectivity and antiviral immune responses of this apical-out porcine intestinal organoid, a swine enteric virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was employed to inoculate the culture system. Both reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) analysis demonstrated that TGEV replicated in the apical-out porcine intestinal organoid culture system. Additionally, our results illustrated that TGEV infection significantly upregulated the expression levels of alpha interferon (IFN-), IFN-1, interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), ISG58, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in this culture system. Hence, we successfully developed a porcine intestinal apical-out organoid culture system, which will facilitate the investigation of pathogen-host interactions in pig intestines.IMPORTANCE Intestinal organoids are a newly developed culture system for investigating pathogen-host interactions. Intestinal organoid models have been widely used since their development, because the results obtained from this type of culture model better represent physiological conditions than those from well-established cell lines. The three-dimensional (3D) porcine intestinal organoid model was reported in 2018 and 2019 for the investigation of intestinal pathogens. However, those organoid culture models were basal-out intestinal organoids, which are not suitable for porcine enteric virus research because they invade the intestines via the apical side of epithelial cells on villi. In this study, we developed a porcine apical-out intestinal organoid culture system and verified its infectivity, type I and type III interferon (IFN) antiviral responses, and inflammatory responses following infection by a swine enteric virus. Our results imply that this apical-out porcine intestinal organoid culture system is an ideal model for the investigation of interactions between swine enteric viruses and the intestines.","10.1128/jvi.01006-20",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

4269,"The Pax6 master control gene initiates spontaneous retinal development via a self-organising turing network; NA; Understanding how complex organ systems are assembled from simple embryonic tissues is a major challenge. Across the animal kingdom a great diversity of visual organs are initiated by a 'master control gene' called Pax6, which is both necessary and sufficient for eye development. Yet precisely how Pax6 achieves this deeply homologous function is poorly understood. Using the chick as a model organism, we show that vertebrate Pax6 interacts with a pair of morphogen-coding genes, Tgfb2 and Fst, to form a putative Turing network, which we have computationally modelled. Computer simulations suggest that this gene network is sufficient to spontaneously polarise the developing retina, establishing the first organisational axis of the eye and prefiguring its further development. Our findings reveal how retinal self-organisation may be initiated independently of the highly ordered tissue interactions that help to assemble the eye in vivo. These results help to explain how stem cell aggregates spontaneously self-organise into functional eye-cups in vitro.

Understanding the mechanisms of infection, however, has been hindered due to the lack of appropriate models that recapitulate the complexity of the intestinal epithelium. Here, we describe an in vitro platform using stem cell-derived intestinal organoids established for four species that are important hosts of Apicomplexa and other protozoa in a zoonotic context: human, mouse, pig and chicken. The focus was set to create organoid-derived monolayers (ODMs) using the transwell system amenable for infection studies, and we provide straightforward guidelines for their generation and differentiation from organ-derived intestinal crypts. To this end, we reduced medium variations to an absolute minimum, allowing generation and differentiation of three-dimensional organoids for all four species and the subsequent generation of ODMs. Quantitative RT-PCR, immunolabeling with antibodies against marker proteins as well as transepithelial-electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were used to characterize ODM's integrity and functional state. These experiments show an overall uniform generation of monolayers suitable for Toxoplasma gondii infection, although robustness in terms of generation of stable TEER levels and cell differentiation status varies from species to species. Murine duodenal ODMs were then infected with T. gondii and/or Giardia duodenalis, two parasites that temporarily co-inhabit the intestinal niche but have not been studied previously in cellular co-infection models. T. gondii alone did not alter TEER values, integrity and transcriptional abundance of tight junction components. In contrast, in G. duodenalis-infected ODMs all these parameters were altered and T. gondii had no apparent influence on the G. duodenalis-triggered phenotype. In conclusion, we provide robust protocols for the generation, differentiation and characterization of intestinal organoids and ODMs from four species. We show their applications for comparative studies on parasite-host interactions during the early phase of a T. gondii infection but also its use for co-infections with other relevant intestinal protozoans.","10.3389/fcimb.2020.610368",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Method(s): Preterm (10- and 5-d preterm) and term pigs at birth, together with 7- and 35-d-old pigs were studied. Gene expression was measured in jejunal samples and in enteroids derived from this segment. Whole body citrulline production was measured by isotope dilution and enteroid citrulline production by accumulation in the media. Result(s): With the exception of arginase I and inducible nitric oxide synthase, all the genes investigated expressed in jejunum were expressed by enteroids. In the jejunum, established markers of development (lactase and sucrase-isomaltase), as well as genes that code for enzymes involved in the production and utilization of citrulline and arginine, underwent the ontogenic changes described in the literature. However, enteroid expression of these genes, as well as citrulline production, failed to recapitulate the changes observed in vivo. Conclusion(s): Under culture conditions used in our study, enteroids derived from jejunal crypts of pigs at different ages failed to replicate the gene expression observed in whole tissue and whole body citrulline production. Additional extracellular cues may be needed to reproduce the age-dependent phenotype.","10.14814/phy2.14565",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4394,"Hormone-responsive organoids from domestic mare and endangered Przewalski's horse endometrium.; NA; The endometrium, the inner uterine lining, is composed of cell layers that come in direct contact with an embryo during early pregnancy and later with the fetal placenta. The endometrium is responsible for signals associated with normal reproductive cyclicity as well as maintenance of pregnancy. In the mare, functionally competent in vitro models of the endometrium have not been successful. Furthermore, the ability to study various reproductive processes in vitro may allow critical evaluation of signaling pathways involved in the reproductive diseases of animals that cannot be handled frequently, such as various wildlife species. Here we report the establishment of organoids, 3D structures, derived from fresh and frozen-thawed equine endometrium (Equus ferus caballus and E. f. przewalskii). Although organoids from domestic mares responded to exogenous hormonal stimuli, organoids from Przewalski's horse failed to respond to exogenous hormones. The present study represents a 'first' for any large animal model or endangered species. These physiologically functional organoids may facilitate improved understanding of normal reproductive mechanisms, uterine pathologies, and signaling mechanisms between the conceptus and endometrium and may lead to the development of novel bioassays for drug discovery.","10.1530/rep-20-0266",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4438,"Investigation of Clinical Safety of Human iPS Cell-Derived Liver Organoid Transplantation to Infantile Patients in Porcine Model; NA; Transplantation of liver organoids has been investigated as a treatment alternative to liver transplantation for chronic liver disease. Transportal approach can be considered as a method of delivering organoids to the liver. It is important to set the allowable organoid amount and verify translocation by intraportal transplantation. We first examined the transplantation tolerance and translocation of porcine fetal liver-derived allogeneic organoids using piglets. Fetal liver-derived organoids generated from the Kusabira Orange-transduced pig were transplanted to the 10-day-old piglet liver through the left branch of the portal vein. All recipients survived without any observable adverse events. In contrast, both local and main portal pressures increased transiently during transplantation. In necropsy samples, Kusabira Orange-positive donor cells were detected primarily in the target lobe of the liver and partly in other areas, including the lungs and brain. As we confirmed the transplantation allowance by porcine fetal liver-derived organoids, we performed intraportal transplantation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived liver organoid, which we plan to use in clinical trials, and portal pressure and translocation were investigated. Human iPSC-derived liver organoids were transplanted into the same 10-day-old piglet. Portal hypertension and translocation of human iPSC-derived liver organoids to the lungs were observed in one of two transplanted animals. Translocation occurred in the piglet in which patent ductus venosus (PDV) was observed. Therefore, a 28-day-old piglet capable of surgically ligating PDV was used, and after the PDV was ligated, human iPSC-derived liver organoids with the amount of which is scheduled in clinical trials were transplanted. This procedure inhibited the translocation of human iPSC-derived liver organoids to extrahepatic sites without no portal hypertension. In conclusion, human iPSC-derived liver organoids can be safely transplanted through the portal vein. Ligation of the ductus venosus prior to transplantation was effective in inhibiting extrahepatic translocation in newborns and infants.","10.1177/0963689720964384",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4491,"Digestion degree is a key factor to regulate the printability of pure tendon decellularized extracellular matrix bio-ink in extrusion-based 3D cell printing; 3D bioprinting;  bio-ink;  dECM;  printability; Improving the printability of pure, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) bio-ink without altering its physiological components has been a challenge in three-dimensional (3D) cell printing. To improve the printability of the bio-ink, we first investigated the digestion process of the powdered dECM material obtained from porcine tendons. We manifested the digestion process of tendon derived dECM powders, which includes dissolution, gelatinization and solubilization. After a short dissolution period (around 10 min), we observed a 'High viscosity slurry' status (3 h) of the dECM precursors, i.e. the gelatinization process, followed by the solubilization processes, i.e. a 'Medium viscosity slurry' period (12 h) and a 'Low viscosity slurry' period (72 h). The 'Medium viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink was inhomogeneous and could not be extruded out from the barrel after the pH value was neutralized to 7.4. Although the 'Low viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink has been reported to be extrudable, it has poor printability. This study explores the printability of the 'High viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink, which has not been addressed thus far. The results demonstrate that this less digested status of the dECM bio-ink yields higher shape fidelity and stacking accuracy than the traditional over-digested status of the dECM bio-ink; this indicates better printability of this less digested dECM bio-ink. We compared the performance of the two bio-inks using cell viability tests for 3D cell printing. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived from rats was printed using the 'High viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink, yielding high cellular viability lasting for 7 d after printing. Thus, the 'High viscosity slurry' status of tendon dECM bio-ink can be utilized to fabricate complicated 3D organoid structures; it also shows promise for applications such as regenerative medicine and biomimetic tissue engineering.  2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","10.1088/1758-5090/aba411",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4509,"l-Glutamate drives porcine intestinal epithelial renewal by increasing stem cell activity via upregulation of the EGFR-ERK-mTORC1 pathway.; NA; l-Glutamate (Glu) is a nutritionally functional amino acid for pigs. In addition, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) maintain epithelial renewal and homeostasis by dynamically regulating proliferation and differentiation to cope with environmental cues. The rapid renewal of the intestinal epithelium requires a continuous supply of energy sources such as Glu. However, the effects of Glu on ISCs and epithelial renewal are poorly understood. In this study, we found that dietary Glu accelerated intestinal epithelial renewal and gut growth. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling were involved in this response in piglets. Subsequent cellular assessment suggested that the EGFR/ERK pathway was upstream of Glu-induced mTORC1 signaling activation. Furthermore, we found that Glu activated the EGFR/ERK pathway and promoted ISC proliferation and differentiation in porcine intestinal organoids. Collectively, our findings suggest that Glu drives intestinal epithelial renewal by increasing ISC activity via the EGFR/ERK/mTORC1 pathway. The present study provides direct evidence that mTORC1 is activated by extracellular Glu through EGFR and that Glu acts as a nutritionally functional amino acid for piglets to maintain intestinal growth and health.","10.1039/c9fo03065d",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4528,"Establishment of 2.5D organoid culture model using 3D bladder cancer organoid culture.; NA; Three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture holds great promises in cancer precision medicine. However, Matrigel and stem cell-stimulating supplements are necessary for culturing 3D organoid cells. It costs a lot of money and consumes more time and effort compared with 2D cultured cells. Therefore, the establishment of cheaper and Matrigel-free organoid culture that can maintain the characteristics of a part of 3D organoids is demanded. In the previous study, we established a dog bladder cancer (BC) 3D organoid culture system by using their urine samples. Here, we successfully isolated cells named ""2.5D organoid"" from multiple strains of dog BC 3D organoids using 2.5 organoid media. The cell proliferation speed of 2.5D organoids was faster than parental 3D organoid cells. The expression pattern of stem cell markers was close to 3D organoids. Injection of 2.5D organoid cells into immunodeficient mice formed tumors and showed the histopathological characteristics of urothelial carcinoma similar to the injection of dog BC 3D organoids. The 2.5D organoids had a similar sensitivity profile for anti-cancer drug treatment to their parental 3D organoids. These data suggest that our established 2.5D organoid culture method might become a reasonable and useful tool instead of 3D organoids in dog BC research and therapy.","10.1038/s41598-020-66229-w",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4654,"Early pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis gallbladder disease in a porcine model.; NA; Hepatobiliary disease causes significant morbidity in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), yet this problem remains understudied. We previously found that newborn CF pigs have microgallbladders with significant luminal obstruction in the absence of infection and consistent inflammation. In this study, we sought to better understand the early pathogenesis of CF pig gallbladder disease. We hypothesized that loss of CFTR would impair gallbladder epithelium anion/liquid secretion and increase mucin production. CFTR was expressed apically in non-CF pig gallbladder epithelium but was absent in CF. CF pig gallbladders lacked cAMP-stimulated anion transport. Using a novel gallbladder epithelial organoid model, we found that Cl(-) or HCO(3)(-) was sufficient for non-CF organoid swelling. This response was absent for non-CF organoids in Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-)-free conditions and in CF. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed a single epithelial cell type in non-CF gallbladders that coexpressed CFTR, MUC5AC, and MUC5B. Despite CF gallbladders having increased luminal MUC5AC and MUC5B accumulation, there was no significant difference in the epithelial expression of gel-forming mucins between non-CF and CF pig gallbladders. In conclusion, these data suggest that loss of CFTR-mediated anion transport and fluid secretion contribute to microgallbladder development and luminal mucus accumulation in CF.","10.1038/s41374-020-0474-8",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4660,"Aminopeptidase N Expression, Not Interferon Responses, Determines the Intestinal Segmental Tropism of Porcine Deltacoronavirus.; APN and PDCoV and enteroids and interferon and interferon receptor; Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an economically important enteropathogen of swine with worldwide distribution. PDCoV primarily infects the small intestine instead of the large intestine in vivo However, the underlying mechanism of PDCoV tropism to different intestinal segments remains poorly understood as a result of the lack of a suitable in vitro intestinal model that recapitulates the cellular diversity and complex functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we established the PDCoV infection model of crypt-derived enteroids from different intestinal segments. Enteroids were susceptible to PDCoV, and multiple types of different functional intestinal epithelia were infected by PDCoV in vitro and in vivo We further found that PDCoV favorably infected the jejunum and ileum and restrictedly replicated in the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, enteroids from different intestinal regions displayed a distinct gene expression profile, and the differential expression of primary viral receptor host aminopeptidase N (APN) instead of the interferon (IFN) responses determined the susceptibility of different intestinal segments to PDCoV, although PDCoV substantially elicited antiviral genes production in enteroids after infection. Additional studies showed that PDCoV infection significantly induced the expression of type I and III IFNs at the late stage of infection, and exogenous IFN inhibited PDCoV replication in enteroids. Hence, our results provide critical inputs to further dissect the molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-host interactions and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The zoonotic potential of the PDCoV, a coronavirus efficiently infecting cells from a broad range species, including porcine, chicken, and human, emphasizes the urgent need to further study the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV in its natural host. Herein, we generated crypt stem cell-derived enteroids from porcine different intestinal regions, which well recapitulated the events in vivo of PDCoV infection that PDCoV targeted multiple types of intestinal epithelia and preferably infected the jejunum and ileum over the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the expression of APN receptor rather than the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different regions of the intestines to PDCoV infection, though PDCoV infection markedly elicited the IFN responses. Our findings provide important insights into how the distinct gene expression profiles of the intestinal segments determine the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV.","10.1128/jvi.00480-20",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4729,"Beta-amyloid deposition around hepatic bile ducts is a novel pathobiological and diagnostic feature of biliary atresia.; Amyloid and Bile duct and Cholangiopathy and Liver disease and Organoid and Transplantation; BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biliary atresia (BA) is a poorly understood and devastating obstructive bile duct disease of newborns. It is often diagnosed late, is incurable and frequently requires liver transplantation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis and molecular signatures associated with BA. METHODS: We combined organoid and transcriptomic analysis to gain new insights into BA pathobiology using patient samples and a mouse model of BA. RESULTS: Liver organoids derived from patients with BA and a rhesus rotavirus A-infected mouse model of BA, exhibited aberrant morphology and disturbed apical-basal organization. Transcriptomic analysis of BA organoids revealed a shift from cholangiocyte to hepatocyte transcriptional signatures and altered beta-amyloid-related gene expression. Beta-amyloid accumulation was observed around the bile ducts in BA livers and exposure to beta-amyloid induced the aberrant morphology in control organoids. CONCLUSION: The novel observation that beta-amyloid accumulates around bile ducts in the livers of patients with BA has important pathobiological implications, as well as diagnostic potential. LAY SUMMARY: Biliary atresia is a poorly understood and devastating obstructive bile duct disease of newborns. It is often diagnosed late, is incurable and frequently requires liver transplantation. Using human and mouse 'liver mini-organs in the dish', we unexpectedly identified beta-amyloid deposition - the main pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy - around bile ducts in livers from patients with biliary atresia.

4749,"A phospho-switch controls RNF43-mediated degradation of Wnt receptors to suppress tumorigenesis.; NA; Frequent mutation of the tumour suppressor RNF43 is observed in many cancers, particularly colon malignancies. RNF43, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates Wnt signalling by inducing degradation of the Wnt receptor Frizzled. In this study, we discover that RNF43 activity requires phosphorylation at a triplet of conserved serines. This phospho-regulation of RNF43 is required for zebrafish development and growth of mouse intestinal organoids. Cancer-associated mutations that abrogate RNF43 phosphorylation cooperate with active Ras to promote tumorigenesis by abolishing the inhibitory function of RNF43 in Wnt signalling while maintaining its inhibitory function in p53 signalling. Our data suggest that RNF43 mutations cooperate with KRAS mutations to promote multi-step tumorigenesis via the Wnt-Ras-p53 axis in human colon cancers. Lastly, phosphomimetic substitutions of the serine trio restored the tumour suppressive activity of extracellular oncogenic mutants. Therefore, harnessing phospho-regulation of RNF43 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for tumours with RNF43 mutations.","10.1038/s41467-020-18257-3",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of jejunum organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including small intestine specific genes, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most small intestine-specific genes were not expressed in the jejunum cell line IPEC-J2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells.","10.3389/fcell.2020.00375",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4820,"Culture of rabbit caecum organoids by reconstituting the intestinal stem cell niche in vitro with pharmacological inhibitors or L-WRN conditioned medium; NA; Intestinal organoids are self-organized 3-dimensional (3D) structures formed by a single layer of polarized epithelial cells. This innovative in vitro model is highly relevant to study physiology of the intestinal epithelium and its role in nutrition and barrier function. However, this model has never been developed in rabbits, while it would have potential applications for biomedical and veterinary research. Here, we cultured rabbit caecum organoids with either pharmacological inhibitors (2Ki medium) or L-WRN cells conditioned medium (L-WRN CM) to reconstitute the intestinal stem cell niche in vitro. Large spherical organoids were obtained with the 2Ki medium and this morphology was associated with a high level of proliferation and stem cells markers gene expression. In contrast, organoids cultured with L-WRN CM had a smaller diameter; a greater cell height and part of them were not spherical. When the L-WRN CM was used at low concentration (5%) for two days, the gene expression of stem cells and proliferation markers were very low, while absorptive and secretory cells markers and antimicrobial peptides were elevated. Epithelial cells within organoids were polarized in 3D cultures with 2Ki medium or L-WRN CM (apical side towards the lumen). We cultured dissociated organoid cells in 2D monolayers, which allowed accessibility to the apical compartment. Under these conditions, actin stress fibers were observed with the 2Ki medium, while perijonctionnal localization of actin was observed with the L-WRN CM suggesting, in 2D cultures as well, a higher differentiation level in the presence of L-WRN CM. In conclusion, rabbit caecum organoids cultured with the 2Ki medium were more proliferative and less differentiated than organoids cultured with L-WRN CM. We propose that organoids cultured with the 2Ki medium could be used to rapidly generate in vitro a large number of rabbit intestinal epithelial stem cells while organoids cultured with the L-WRN CM used at low concentration represent a suitable model to study differentiated rabbit epithelium.","10.1016/j.scr.2020.101980",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4861,"Production and characterization of avian crypt-villus enteroids and the effect of chemicals; Avian intestinal mucosa;  Effects of chemicals;  Enteroids;  Immunochemical characterization; Background: Three-dimensional models of cell culture such as organoids and mini organs accord better advantage over regular cell culture because of their ability to simulate organ functions hence, used for disease modeling, metabolic research, and the development of therapeutics strategies. However, most advances in this area are limited to mammalian species with little progress in others such as poultry where it can be deployed to study problems of agricultural importance. In the course of enterocyte culture in chicken, we observed that intestinal mucosal villus-crypts self-repair and form spheroid-like structures which appear to be useful as ex vivo models to study enteric physiology and diseases. Results: The villus-crypts harvested from chicken intestinal mucosa were cultured to generate enteroids, purified by filtration then re cultured with different chemicals and growth factors to assess their response based on their morphological dispositions. Histochemical analyses using marker antibodies and probes showed the enteroids consisting different cell types such as epithelial, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells typical to villi and retain functional characteristics of intestinal mucosa. Conclusions: We present a simple procedure to generate avian crypt-villous enteroids containing different cell types. Because the absorptive cells are functionally positioned outwards, similar to the luminal enterocytes, the cells have better advantages to interact with the factors present in the culture medium. Thus, the enteroids have the potential to study the physiology, metabolism, and pathology of the intestinal villi and can be useful for preliminary screenings of the factors that may affect gut health in a cost-effective manner and reduce the use of live animals.  2020 The Author(s).","10.1186/s12917-020-02397-1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"
4879,"The growth of endothelial-like cells in zebrafish embryoid body culture.; Blastocyst cells and Embryoid body and Endothelial differentiation and fli:GFP and kdrl:GFP; There is increasing interest in the possibility of culturing organ-like tissues (organoids) in vitro for biomedical applications. The ability to culture organoids would be greatly enhanced by having a functional circulation in vitro. The endothelial cell is the most important cell type in this context. Endothelial cells can be derived from pluripotent embryonic blastocyst cells in aggregates called embryoid bodies. Here, we examine the yield of endothelial-like cells in embryoid bodies (EBs) developed from transgenic zebrafish fli:GFP and kdrl:GFP blastocyst embryos. The isolated blastocyst cells developed into EBs within the first 24 h of culture and contained fli:GFP(+) (putative endothelial, hematopoietic and other cell types); or kdrl:GFP(+) (endothelial) cells. The addition of endothelial growth supplements to the media and culture on collagen type-I substratum increased the percentages of fli:GFP(+) and kdrl:GFP(+) cells in culture. We found that EBs developed in hanging-drop cultures possessed a higher percentage of fli:GFP(+) (45.0  3.1%) and kdrl:GFP(+) cells (8.7  0.7%) than those developed on conventional substrata (34.5  1.4% or 5.2  0.4%, respectively). The transcriptome analysis showed a higher expression of VEGF and TGF genes in EB cultures compared to the adherent cultures. When transferred to conventional culture, the percentage of fli:GFP(+) or kdrl:GFP(+) cells declined significantly over subsequent days in the EBs. The fli:GFP(+) cells formed a monolayer around the embryoid bodies, while the kdrl:GFP(+) cells formed vascular network-like structures in the embryoid bodies. Differences were observed in the spreading of fli:GFP(+) cells, and network formation of kdrl:GFP(+) cells on different substrates. The fli:GFP(+) cells could be maintained in primary culture and sub-cultures. By contrast, kdrl:GFP(+) cells were almost completely absent at 8d of primary culture. Our culture model allows real-time observation of fli:GFP(+) and kdrl:GFP(+) cells in culture. The results obtained from this study will be important for the development of vascular and endothelial cell culture using embryonic cells.","10.1016/j.yexcr.2020.112032",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
4940,"Gut microbiota derived metabolites contribute to intestinal barrier maturation at the suckling-to-weaning transition; NA; In suckling mammals, the onset of solid food ingestion is coincident with the maturation of the gut barrier. This ontogenic process is driven by the colonization of the intestine by the microbiota. However, the mechanisms underlying the microbial regulation of the intestinal development in early life are not fully understood. Here, we studied the co-maturation of the microbiota (composition and metabolic activity) and of the gut barrier at the suckling-to-weaning transition by using a combination of experiments in vivo (suckling rabbit model), ex vivo (Ussing chambers) and in vitro (epithelial cell lines and organoids). The microbiota composition, its metabolic activity, para-cellular epithelial permeability and the gene expression of key components of the gut barrier shifted sharply at the onset of solid food ingestion in vivo, despite milk was still predominant in the diet at that time. We found that cecal content sterile supernatant (i.e. containing a mixture of metabolites) obtained after the onset of solid food ingestion accelerated the formation of the epithelial barrier in Caco-2 cells in vitro and our results suggested that these effects were driven by the bacterial metabolite butyrate. Moreover, the treatment of organoids with cecal content sterile supernatant partially replicated in vitro the effects of solid food ingestion on the epithelial barrier in vivo. Altogether, our results show that the metabolites produced by the microbiota at the onset of solid food ingestion contribute to the maturation of the gut barrier at the suckling-to-weaning transition. Targeting the gut microbiota metabolic activity during this key developmental window might therefore be a promising strategy to promote intestinal homeostasis.","10.1080/19490976.2020.1747335",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

MVID is a complex disorder characterized by chronic, watery, life-threatening diarrhea that usually begins in the first hours to days of life. We developed a large animal model of MVID to better understand its pathophysiology. METHODS: Pigs were cloned by transfer of chromatin from swine primary fetal fibroblasts, which were edited with TALENs and single-strand oligonucleotide to introduce a P663-L663 substitution in the endogenous swine MYO5B (corresponding to the P660L mutation in human MYO5B, associated with MVID) to fertilized oocytes. We analyzed duodenal tissues from patients with MVID (with the MYO5B P660L mutation) and without (controls), and from pigs using immunohistochemistry. Enteroids were generated from pigs with MYO5B(P663L) and without the substitution (control pigs). RESULTS: Duodenal tissues from patients with MVID lacked MYO5B at the base of the apical membrane of intestinal cells; instead MYO5B was intracellular. Intestinal tissues and derived enteroids from MYO5B(P663L) piglets had reduced apical levels and diffuse subapical levels of sodium hydrogen exchanger 3 and SGLT1, which regulate transport of sodium, glucose, and water, compared with tissues from control piglets. However, intestinal tissues and derived enteroids from MYO5B(P663L) piglets maintained CFTR on apical membranes, like tissues from control pigs. Liver tissues from MYO5B(P663L) piglets had alterations in bile salt export pump, a transporter that facilitates bile flow, which is normally expressed in the bile canaliculi in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a large animal model of MVID that has many features of the human disease. Studies of this model could provide information about the functions of MYO5B and MVID pathogenesis, and might lead to new treatments.","10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.034",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

To investigate the role and mechanism of copper in the sheep pancreas, we first established sheep pancreatic duct organoids (sPDOs). We found that an appropriate amount of copper benefited the formation and growth of sPDOs, whereas excess or deficient copper damaged sPDOs. We found that the proliferation-stimulating effect of copper was related to the copper chaperone antioxidant protein 1 (ATOX1)-dependent activation of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling. Atox1 knockdown suppressed the cell proliferation of sPDOs, even in the presence of the MEK activator. These results indicate that moderate concentrations of copper promote sPDO growth through ATOX1-regulated cell proliferation by activation of MEK-ERK.

5020,"Utility Evaluation of Porcine Enteroids as PDCoV Infection Model in vitro; NA; Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel emerging enteric coronavirus found in pigs. Intestinal enteroids, which partially recreate the structure and function of intestinal villi-crypts, have many physiological similarities to the intestinal tissues in vivo. Enteroids exhibit advantages in studying the interactions between intestines and enteric pathogens. To create a novel infection model for PDCoV, we developed an in vitro system to generate porcine intestinal enteroids from crypts of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of pigs. Enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, stem cells, proliferating cells, and goblet cells were found in the differentiated enteroids. Replication of PDCoV was detected in the cultured enteroids by immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that PDCoV was present in Sox9-positive intestinal cells and Villin1-positive enterocytes. There were multiple cellular responses shown as changes of transcription of genes related to mucosal immunity, antiviral genes, and marker genes of stem cells and other cells in the enteroids infected with PDCoV.

Enhanced proliferation and transepithelial chloride secretion through cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Ca(2+)-activated TMEM16A Cl(-) channels is thought to cause an increase in cyst volume. Recent work shows the pro-proliferative role of the Ca(2+) activated Cl(-) channel TMEM16A (anoctamin 1), and demonstrates the essential contribution of TMEM16A to CFTR-dependent Cl(-) secretion. The present data demonstrate an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) signals and Cl(-) secretion by TMEM16A, in renal collecting duct principle cells from dog (MDCK) and mouse (M1) as well as primary tubular epithelial cells from PKD1-/- knockout mice. M1 organoids proliferated, increased expression of TMEM16A, and secreted Cl(-) upon knockdown of endogenous polycystin 1 or 2 (PKD1,2), by retroviral transfection with shPKD1 and shPKD2, respectively. Knockdown of PKD1 or PKD2 increased basal intracellular Ca(2+) levels and enhanced purinergic Ca(2+) release from endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, ryanodine receptors were found not to be expressed in mouse renal epithelial cells and caffeine had no effects on [Ca(2+)]i. Ca(2+) signals, proliferation, and Cl(-) secretion were largely reduced by knockdown or blockade of TMEM16A. TMEM16A may be therefore important for enhanced Ca(2+) release from IP(3)-sensitive Ca(2+) stores in polycystic kidney disease. KEY MESSAGES:  ADPKD leads to continuous decline of renal function by growth of renal cysts.  Knockdown of PKD1 or PKD2 increases TMEM16A expression.  TMEM16A enhanced intracellular Ca(2+) signals, Cl(-) secretion, and proliferation.  TMEM16A contributes to cyst growth in ADPKD.","10.1007/s00109-020-01894-y",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5071,"Recapitulation of the accessible interface of biopsy-derived canine intestinal organoids to study epithelial-luminal interactions.; NA; Recent advances in canine intestinal organoids have expanded the option for building a better in vitro model to investigate translational science of intestinal physiology and pathology between humans and animals. However, the three-dimensional geometry and the enclosed lumen of canine intestinal organoids considerably hinder the access to the apical side of epithelium for investigating the nutrient and drug absorption, host-microbiome crosstalk, and pharmaceutical toxicity testing. Thus, the creation of a polarized epithelial interface accessible from apical or basolateral side is critical. Here, we demonstrated the generation of an intestinal epithelial monolayer using canine biopsy-derived colonic organoids (colonoids). We optimized the culture condition to form an intact monolayer of the canine colonic epithelium on a nanoporous membrane insert using the canine colonoids over 14 days. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed a physiological brush border interface covered by the microvilli with glycocalyx, as well as the presence of mucin granules, tight junctions, and desmosomes. The population of stem cells as well as differentiated lineage-dependent epithelial cells were verified by immunofluorescence staining and RNA in situ hybridization. The polarized expression of P-glycoprotein efflux pump was confirmed at the apical membrane. Also, the epithelial monolayer formed tight- and adherence-junctional barrier within 4 days, where the transepithelial electrical resistance and apparent permeability were inversely correlated. Hence, we verified the stable creation, maintenance, differentiation, and physiological function of a canine intestinal epithelial barrier, which can be useful for pharmaceutical and biomedical researches.","10.1371/journal.pone.0231423",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5085,"Generation of Differentiating and Long-Living Intestinal Organoids Reflecting the Cellular Diversity of Canine Intestine.; canine intestine and differentiation and intestinal organoids and organoid culture; Functional intestinal disorders constitute major, potentially lethal health problems in humans. Consequently, research focuses on elucidating the underlying pathobiological mechanisms and establishing therapeutic strategies. In this context, intestinal organoids have emerged as a potent in vitro model as they faithfully recapitulate the structure and function of the intestinal segment they represent. Interestingly, human-like intestinal diseases also affect dogs, making canine intestinal organoids a promising tool for canine and comparative research. Therefore, we generated organoids from canine duodenum, jejunum and colon, and focused on simultaneous long-term expansion and cell differentiation to maximize applicability. Following their establishment, canine intestinal organoids were grown under various culture conditions and then analyzed with respect to cell viability/apoptosis and multi-lineage differentiation by transcription profiling, proliferation assay, cell staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Standard expansion medium supported long-term expansion of organoids irrespective of their origin, but inhibited cell differentiation. Conversely, transfer of organoids to differentiation medium promoted goblet cell and enteroendocrine cell development, but simultaneously induced apoptosis. Unimpeded stem cell renewal and concurrent differentiation was achieved by culturing organoids in the presence of tyrosine kinase ligands. Our findings unambiguously highlight the characteristic cellular diversity of canine duodenum, jejunum and colon as fundamental prerequisite for accurate in vitro modelling.","10.3390/cells9040822",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5093,"Loss-of-function mutations in UDP-Glucose 6-Dehydrogenase cause recessive developmental epileptic encephalopathy.; NA; Developmental epileptic encephalopathies are devastating disorders characterized by intractable epileptic seizures and developmental delay. Here, we report an allelic series of germline recessive mutations in UGDH in 36 cases from 25 families presenting with epileptic encephalopathy with developmental delay and hypotonia. UGDH encodes an oxidoreductase that converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, a key component of specific proteoglycans and glycolipids. Consistent with being loss-of-function alleles, we show using patients' primary fibroblasts and biochemical assays, that these mutations either impair UGDH stability, oligomerization, or enzymatic activity. In vitro, patient-derived cerebral organoids are smaller with a reduced number of proliferating neuronal progenitors while mutant ugdh zebrafish do not phenocopy the human disease. Our study defines UGDH as a key player for the production of extracellular matrix components that are essential for human brain development. Based on the incidence of variants observed, UGDH mutations are likely to be a frequent cause of recessive epileptic encephalopathy.","10.1038/s41467-020-14360-7",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5141,"Drug Screen Identifies Leflunomide for Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Caused by TTC7A Deficiency.; Animal Model and Cell Death and Genetic and Monogenic IBD; BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mutations in the tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A gene (TTC7A) cause intestinal epithelial and immune defects. Patients can become immune deficient and develop apoptotic enterocolitis, multiple intestinal atresia, and recurrent intestinal stenosis. The intestinal disease in patients with TTC7A deficiency is severe and untreatable, and it recurs despite resection or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. We screened drugs for those that prevent apoptosis of in cells with TTC7A deficiency and tested their effects in an animal model of the disease. METHODS: We developed a high-throughput screen to identify compounds approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that reduce activity of caspases 3 and 7 in TTC7A-knockout (TTC7A-KO) HAP1 (human haploid) cells and reduce the susceptibility to apoptosis. We validated the effects of identified agents in HeLa cells that stably express TTC7A with point mutations found in patients. Signaling pathways in cells were analyzed by immunoblots. We tested the effects of identified agents in zebrafish with disruption of ttc7a, which develop intestinal defects, and colonoids derived from biopsy samples of patients with and without mutations in TTC7A. We performed real-time imaging of intestinal peristalsis in zebrafish and histologic analyses of intestinal tissues from patients and zebrafish. Colonoids were analyzed by immunofluorescence and for ion transport. RESULTS: TTC7A-KO HAP1 cells have abnormal morphology and undergo apoptosis, due to increased levels of active caspases 3 and 7. We identified drugs that increased cell viability; leflunomide (used to treat patients with inflammatory conditions) reduced caspase 3 and 7 activity in cells by 96%. TTC7A-KO cells contained cleaved caspase 3 and had reduced levels of phosphorylated AKT and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP); incubation of these cells with leflunomide increased levels of phosphorylated AKT and XIAP and reduced levels of cleaved caspase 3. Administration of leflunomide to ttc7a(-/-) zebrafish increased gut motility, reduced intestinal tract narrowing, increased intestinal cell survival, increased sizes of intestinal luminal spaces, and restored villi and goblet cell morphology. Exposure of patient-derived colonoids to leflunomide increased cell survival, polarity, and transport function. CONCLUSIONS: In a drug screen, we identified leflunomide as an agent that reduces apoptosis and activates AKT signaling in TTC7A-KO cells. In zebrafish with disruption of ttc7a, leflunomide restores gut motility, reduces intestinal tract narrowing, and increases intestinal cell survival. This drug might be repurposed for treatment of TTC7A deficiency.","10.1053/j.gastro.2019.11.019",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5160,"Identification of potential drugs for treatment of hepatic lipidosis in cats using an in vitro feline liver organoid system.; AICAR and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 inhibitor and hepatic organoids and perilipin 2 and steatosis; BACKGROUND: Hepatic lipidosis is increasing in incidence in the Western world, with cats being particularly sensitive. When cats stop eating and start utilizing their fat reserves, free fatty acids (FFAs) increase in blood, causing an accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the liver. OBJECTIVE: Identifying potential new drugs that can be used to treat hepatic lipidosis in cats using a feline hepatic organoid system. ANIMALS: Liver organoids obtained from 6 cats. METHODS: Eight different drugs were tested, and the 2 most promising were further studied using a quantitative TAG assay, lipid droplet staining, and qPCR. RESULTS: Both T863 (a diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 [DGAT1] inhibitor) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1--D-ribofuranoside (AICAR; an adenosine monophosphate kinase activator) decreased TAG accumulation by 55% (P <.0001) and 46% (P =.0003), respectively. Gene expression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) increased upon the addition of FFAs to the medium and decreased upon treatment with AICAR but not significantly after treatment with T863. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Two potential drugs useful in the treatment of hepatic lipidosis in cats were identified. The drug T863 inhibits DGAT1, indicating that DGAT1 is the primary enzyme responsible for TAG synthesis from external fatty acids in cat organoids. The drug AICAR may act as a lipid-lowering compound via decreasing PLIN2 mRNA. Liver organoids can be used as an in vitro tool for drug testing in a species-specific system and provide the basis for further clinical testing of drugs to treat steatosis.","10.1111/jvim.15670",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5182,"Long-Term Survival of Transplanted Autologous Canine Liver Organoids in a COMMD1-Deficient Dog Model of Metabolic Liver Disease.; Wilsons disease and autologous and cell transplantation and copper and dog and hepatocytes and organoids and transplantation; The shortage of liver organ donors is increasing and the need for viable alternatives is urgent. Liver cell (hepatocyte) transplantation may be a less invasive treatment compared with liver transplantation. Unfortunately, hepatocytes cannot be expanded in vitro, and allogenic cell transplantation requires long-term immunosuppression. Organoid-derived adult liver stem cells can be cultured indefinitely to create sufficient cell numbers for transplantation, and they are amenable to gene correction. This study provides preclinical proof of concept of the potential of cell transplantation in a large animal model of inherited copper toxicosis, such as Wilson's disease, a Mendelian disorder that causes toxic copper accumulation in the liver. Hepatic progenitors from five COMMD1-deficient dogs were isolated and cultured using the 3D organoid culture system. After genetic restoration of COMMD1 expression, the organoid-derived hepatocyte-like cells were safely delivered as repeated autologous transplantations via the portal vein. Although engraftment and repopulation percentages were low, the cells survived in the liver for up to two years post-transplantation. The low engraftment was in line with a lack of functional recovery regarding copper excretion. This preclinical study confirms the survival of genetically corrected autologous organoid-derived hepatocyte-like cells in vivo and warrants further optimization of organoid engraftment and functional recovery in a large animal model of human liver disease.","10.3390/cells9020410",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Here, we introduce a tractable 3D model for mucociliary epithelium generated from multipotent progenitors that were microsurgically isolated from Xenopus laevis embryos. The mucociliary epithelial organoids are covered with newly generated epithelium from deep ectoderm cells and later decorated with distinct patterned multiciliated cells, secretory cells, and mucus-producing goblet cells that are indistinguishable from the native epidermis within 24 h. The full sequences of dynamic cell transitions from mesenchymal to epithelial that emerge on the apical surface of organoids can be tracked by high-resolution live imaging. These in vitro cultured, self-organizing mucociliary epithelial organoids offer distinct advantages in studying the biology of mucociliary epithelium with high-efficiency in generation, defined culture conditions, control over number and size, and direct access for live imaging during the regeneration of the differentiated epithelium.  2020 JoVE.","10.3791/61604",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"yes"
5258,"Optimization of Renal Organoid and Organotypic Culture for Vascularization, Extended Development, and Improved Microscopy Imaging.; NA; Embryonic kidney organotypic cultures, and especially pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids, are excellent tools for following developmental processes and modelling kidney disease. However, the models are limited by a lack of vascularization and functionality. To address this, an improved protocol for the method of xenografting cells and tissues to the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of an avian embryo to gain vascularization and restoration of blood flow was developed. The grafts are overlaid with custom-made minireservoirs that fix the samples to the CAM and supply them with culture medium that protects the grafts from drying. The improved culture method allows xenografts to grow for up to 9 days. The manuscript also describes how to provide optimal conditions for long-term confocal imaging of renal organoids and organotypic cultures using the previously published Fixed Z-Direction (FiZD) method. This method gently compresses an embryonic organ or organoid between a glass coverslip and membrane in a large amount of medium and provides excellent conditions for imaging for up to 12 days. Together, these methods allow vascularization and blood flow to renal organoids and organotypic kidney cultures with improved confocal imaging. The methods described here are highly beneficial for studying fundamental and applied functions of kidneys ex vivo. Both methods are applicable to various types of tissues and organoids.","10.3791/60995",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Traditional cell-line cultures have been used to study L. intracellularis pathogenesis. However, these systems fail to reproduce the epithelial changes observed in the intestines of L. intracellularis-infected pigs, specifically, the changes in intestinal cell constitution and gene expression.

The two-dimensional swine enteroids were infected by L. intracellularis in four independent experiments. Enteroid-infected samples were collected 3 and 7 d postinfection for analysis using real-time quantitative PCR and L. intracellularis immunohistochemistry.

FCoVs present as two main biotypes: the mild feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and the fatal feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FIPV develops through mutations from FECV during a persistence infection. So far, the molecular mechanism of FECV-persistence and contributing factors for FIPV development may not be studied, since field FECV isolates do not grow in available cell culture models. In this work, we aimed at establishing feline ileum and colon organoids that allow the propagation of field FECVs. We have determined the best methods to isolate, culture and passage feline ileum and colon organoids. Importantly, we have demonstrated using GFP-expressing recombinant field FECV that colon organoids are able to support infection of FECV, which were unable to infect traditional feline cell culture models. These organoids in combination with recombinant FECVs can now open the door to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which FECV can persist in the gut for a longer period of time and how transition to FIPV is achieved.","10.3390/cells9092085",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Tissue engineered artificial substitutes could represent a promising approach to tackle this challenge. In our current study, tissue-engineered trachea, based on a 3D-printed poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffold with similar morphology to the native trachea of rabbits, was used for segmental tracheal reconstruction. The 3D-printed scaffolds were seeded with chondrocytes obtained from autologous auricula, dynamically pre-cultured in vitro for 2weeks, and pre-vascularized in vivo for another 2weeks to generate an integrated segmental trachea organoid unit. Then, segmental tracheal defects in rabbits were restored by transplanting the engineered tracheal substitute with pedicled muscular flaps. We found that the combination of in vitro pre-culture and in vivo pre-vascularization successfully generated a segmental tracheal substitute with bionic structure and mechanical properties similar to the native trachea of rabbits. Moreover, the stable blood supply provided by the pedicled muscular flaps facilitated the survival of chondrocytes and accelerated epithelialization, thereby improving the survival rate. The segmental trachea substitute engineered by a 3D-printed scaffold, in vitro pre-culture, and in vivo pre-vascularization enhanced survival in an early stage post-operation, presenting a promising approach for surgical reconstruction of long segmental tracheal defects.

5323,"Formation of organotypic testicular organoids in microwell culture.; organoid and testicular morphogenesis; Three-dimensional (3D) organoids can serve as an in vitro platform to study cell-cell interactions, tissue development, and toxicology. Development of organoids with tissue architecture similar to testis in vivo has remained a challenge. Here, we present a microwell aggregation approach to establish multicellular 3D testicular organoids from pig, mouse, macaque, and human. The organoids consist of germ cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and peritubular myoid cells forming a distinct seminiferous epithelium and interstitial compartment separated by a basement membrane. Sertoli cells in the organoids express tight junction proteins claudin 11 and occludin. Germ cells in organoids showed an attenuated response to retinoic acid compared to germ cells in 2D culture indicating that the tissue architecture of the organoid modulates response to retinoic acid similar to in vivo. Germ cells maintaining physiological cell-cell interactions in organoids also had lower levels of autophagy indicating lower levels of cellular stress. When organoids were treated with mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), levels of germ cell autophagy increased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the utility of the organoids for toxicity screening. Ablation of primary cilia on testicular somatic cells inhibited the formation of organoids demonstrating an application to screen for factors affecting testicular morphogenesis. Organoids can be generated from cryopreserved testis cells and preserved by vitrification. Taken together, the testicular organoid system recapitulates the 3D organization of the mammalian testis and provides an in vitro platform for studying germ cell function, testicular development, and drug toxicity in a cellular context representative of the testis in vivo.","10.1093/biolre/ioz053",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

The matrix is comprised of 1) a solid anisotropic complex scaffold prepared by electrospinning a mixture of recombinant analogues of the spider dragline silk proteins - spidroin 1 (rS1/9) and spidroin 2 (rS2/12) - and polycaprolactone (PCL) (rSS-PCL), and 2) a ""liquid matrix"" based on platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The combination of PRP and spidroin promoted drNPC proliferation with the formation of neural tissue organoids and dramatically activated neurogenesis. Differentiation of drNPCs generated large numbers of III-tubulin and MAP2 positive neurons as well as some GFAP-positive astrocytes, which likely had a neuronal supporting function. Interestingly the SPRPix microfibrils appeared to provide strong guidance cues as the differentiating neurons oriented their processes parallel to them. Implantation of the SPRPix matrix containing human drNPC into the brain and spinal cord of two healthy Rhesus macaque monkeys showed good biocompatibility: no astroglial and microglial reaction was present around the implanted construct.

5407,"Recovirus NS1-2 Has Viroporin Activity That Induces Aberrant Cellular Calcium Signaling To Facilitate Virus Replication.; GCaMP and calcium and calicivirus and viroporin; Enteric viruses in the Caliciviridae family cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals, but the cellular processes needed for virus replication and disease remain unknown. A common strategy among enteric viruses, including rotaviruses and enteroviruses, is to encode a viral ion channel (i.e., viroporin) that is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and disrupts host calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis. Previous reports have demonstrated genetic and functional similarities between the nonstructural proteins of caliciviruses and enteroviruses, including the calicivirus NS1-2 protein and the 2B viroporin of enteroviruses. However, it is unknown whether caliciviruses alter Ca(2+) homeostasis for virus replication or whether the NS1-2 protein has viroporin activity like its enterovirus counterpart. To address these questions, we used Tulane virus (TV), a rhesus enteric calicivirus, to examine Ca(2+) signaling during infection and determine whether NS1-2 has viroporin activity that disrupts Ca(2+) homeostasis. We found that TV increases Ca(2+) signaling during infection and that increased cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels are important for efficient replication. Further, TV NS1-2 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, the predominant intracellular Ca(2+) store, and the NS2 region has characteristics of a viroporin domain (VPD). NS1-2 had viroporin activity in a classic bacterial functional assay and caused aberrant Ca(2+) signaling when expressed in mammalian cells, but truncation of the VPD abrogated these activities. Together, our data provide new mechanistic insights into the function of the NS2 region of NS1-2 and support the premise that enteric viruses, including those within Caliciviridae, exploit host Ca(2+) signaling to facilitate their replication.IMPORTANCE Tulane virus is one of many enteric caliciviruses that cause acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal disease. Globally, enteric caliciviruses affect both humans and animals and amass >65 billion dollars per year in treatment and health care-associated costs, thus imposing an enormous economic burden. Recent progress has resulted in several cultivation systems (B cells, enteroids, and zebrafish larvae) to study human noroviruses, but mechanistic insights into the viral factors and host pathways important for enteric calicivirus replication and infection are still largely lacking. Here, we used Tulane virus, a calicivirus that is biologically similar to human noroviruses and can be cultivated by conventional cell culture, to identify and functionally validate NS1-2 as an enteric calicivirus viroporin. Viroporin-mediated calcium signaling may be a broadly utilized pathway for enteric virus replication, and its existence within caliciviruses provides a novel approach to developing antivirals and comprehensive therapeutics for enteric calicivirus diarrheal disease outbreaks.","10.1128/msphere.00506-19",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5437,"High-throughput mechanotransduction in: Drosophila embryos with mesofluidics; NA; Developing embryos create complexity by expressing genes to coordinate movement which generates mechanical force. An emerging theory is that mechanical force can also serve as an input signal to regulate developmental gene expression. Experimental methods to apply mechanical stimulation to whole embryos have been limited, mainly to aspiration, indentation, or moving a coverslip; these approaches stimulate only a few embryos at a time and require manual alignment. A powerful approach for automation is microfluidic devices, which can precisely manipulate hundreds of samples. However, using microfluidics to apply mechanical stimulation has been limited to small cellular systems, with fewer applications for larger scale whole embryos. We developed a mesofluidic device that applies the precision and automation of microfluidics to the Drosophila embryo: high-throughput automatic alignment, immobilization, compression, real-time imaging, and recovery of hundreds of live embryos. We then use twist:eGFP embryos to show that the mechanical induction of twist depends on the dose and duration of compression. This device allows us to quantify responses to compression, map the distribution of ectopic twist, and measure embryo stiffness. For building mesofluidic devices, we describe modifications on ultra-thick photolithography, derive an analytical model that predicts the deflection of sidewalls, and discuss parametric calibration. This ""mesomechanics"" approach combines the high-throughput automation and precision of microfluidics with the biological relevance of live embryos to examine mechanotransduction.

5449,"Porcine Intestinal Enteroids: a New Model for Studying Enteric Coronavirus Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection and the Host Innate Response.; PEDV and coronavirus and enteroids and interferon and intestine crypt stem cell and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the group of alphacoronaviruses, is the pathogen of a highly contagious gastrointestinal swine disease. The elucidation of the events associated with the intestinal epithelial response to PEDV infection has been limited by the absence of good in vitro porcine intestinal models that recapitulate the multicellular complexity of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we generated swine enteroids from the intestinal crypt stem cells of the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum and found that the generated enteroids are able to satisfactorily recapitulate the complicated intestinal epithelium in vivo and are susceptible to infection by PEDV. PEDV infected multiple types of cells, including enterocytes, stem cells, and goblet cells, and exhibited segmental infection discrepancies compared with ileal enteroids and colonoids, and this finding was verified in vivo Moreover, the clinical isolate PEDV-JMS propagated better in ileal enteroids than the cell-adapted isolate PEDV-CV777, and PEDV infection suppressed interferon (IFN) production early during the infection course. IFN lambda elicited a potent antiviral response and inhibited PEDV in enteroids more efficiently than IFN alpha (IFN-). Therefore, swine enteroids provide a novel in vitro model for exploring the pathogenesis of PEDV and for the in vitro study of the interplay between a host and a variety of swine enteric viruses.IMPORTANCE PEDV is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that causes significant economic losses, and the lack of a good in vitro model system is a major roadblock to an in-depth understanding of PEDV pathogenesis. Here, we generated a porcine intestinal enteroid model for PEDV infection. Utilizing porcine intestinal enteroids, we demonstrated that PEDV infects multiple lineages of the intestinal epithelium and preferably infects ileal enteroids over colonoids and that enteroids prefer to respond to IFN lambda 1 over IFN-. These events recapitulate the events that occur in vivo This study constitutes the first use of a primary intestinal enteroid model to investigate the susceptibility of porcine enteroids to PEDV and to determine the antiviral response following infection. Our study provides important insights into the events associated with PEDV infection of the porcine intestine and provides a valuable in vitro model for studying not only PEDV but also other swine enteric viruses.","10.1128/jvi.01682-18",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5457,"Potential role of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in the modulation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle superoxide by hypoxia.; NADPH oxidases and extracellular matrix and pulmonary hypertension and smooth muscle phenotype and superoxide dismutase; Changes in reactive oxygen species and extracellular matrix seem to participate in pulmonary hypertension development. Because we recently reported evidence for chronic hypoxia decreasing expression of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and evidence for this controlling loss of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle bone morphogenetic protein receptor-2 (BMPR2) and contractile phenotype proteins, we examined if changes in superoxide metabolism could be an important factor in a bovine pulmonary artery (BPA), organoid cultured under hypoxia for 48 h model. Hypoxia (3% O(2)) caused a depletion of COMP in BPA, but not in bovine coronary arteries. Knockdown of COMP by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) increased BPA levels of mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial superoxide detected by MitoSOX and dihydroethidium (DHE) HPLC products. COMP siRNA-treated BPA showed reduced levels of SOD2 and SOD3 and increased levels of NADPH oxidases NOX2 and NOX4. Hypoxia increased BPA levels of MitoSOX-detected superoxide and caused changes in NOX2 and SOD2 expression similar to COMP siRNA, and exogenous COMP (0.5 M) prevented the effects of hypoxia. In the presence of COMP, BMPR2 siRNA-treated BPA showed increases in superoxide detected by MitoSOX and depletion of SOD2. Superoxide scavengers (0.5 M TEMPO or mitoTEMPO) maintained the expression of contractile phenotype proteins calponin and SM22 decreased by 48 h hypoxia (1% O(2)). Adenoviral delivery of BMPR2 to rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells prevented the depletion of calponin and SM22 by COMP siRNA. Thus, COMP regulation of BMPR2 appears to have an important role in controlling hypoxia-elicited changes in BPA superoxide and its potential regulation of contractile phenotype proteins.","10.1152/ajplung.00080.2018",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Numerous individuals have devoted decades of research to unraveling the pathophysiological basis of this cell type. Here, we perform a scoping review of novel in vitro and in vivo methodology pertaining to the parietal cell. First, we evaluate early in vitro methods of parietal cell analysis. This section focuses on three major techniques: gastric gland isolation, parietal cell isolation, and parietal cell culture. We also discuss parietal cell physiology and pathophysiology. Second, we discuss more contemporary efforts involving confocal microscopy and gastric organoids, a new technique that holds much promise in unveiling the temporal-spatial dynamics of the cell. Finally, we will discuss findings from our laboratory where we identified an active gastric vacuolar H(+)-ATPase as a putative mechanism for refractory GERD. Overall, this review aims to highlight the major milestones in understanding an elusive yet important cell. Though in no way comprehensive, we hope to provide a birds-eye view to the study of this unique cell type in the gastrointestinal tract.","10.3389/fphys.2019.01497",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5505,"Derivation of adult canine intestinal organoids for translational research in gastroenterology.; Canine and Enteroid and GI diseases and Intestinal stem cell and Organoid model and Translational research; BACKGROUND: Large animal models, such as the dog, are increasingly being used for studying diseases including gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Dogs share similar environmental, genomic, anatomical, and intestinal physiologic features with humans. To bridge the gap between commonly used animal models, such as rodents, and humans, and expand the translational potential of the dog model, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) canine GI organoid (enteroid and colonoid) system. Organoids have recently gained interest in translational research as this model system better recapitulates the physiological and molecular features of the tissue environment in comparison with two-dimensional cultures. RESULTS: Organoids were derived from tissue of more than 40 healthy dogs and dogs with GI conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intestinal carcinomas. Adult intestinal stem cells (ISC) were isolated from whole jejunal tissue as well as endoscopically obtained duodenal, ileal, and colonic biopsy samples using an optimized culture protocol. Intestinal organoids were comprehensively characterized using histology, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, and transmission electron microscopy, to determine the extent to which they recapitulated the in vivo tissue characteristics. Physiological relevance of the enteroid system was defined using functional assays such as optical metabolic imaging (OMI), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function assay, and Exosome-Like Vesicles (EV) uptake assay, as a basis for wider applications of this technology in basic, preclinical and translational GI research. We have furthermore created a collection of cryopreserved organoids to facilitate future research. CONCLUSIONS: We establish the canine GI organoid systems as a model to study naturally occurring intestinal diseases in dogs and humans, and that can be used for toxicology studies, for analysis of host-pathogen interactions, and for other translational applications.","10.1186/s12915-019-0652-6",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5509,"The migration and fusion events related to ROCK activity strongly influence the morphology of chicken embryo intestinal organoids.; Chicken and Collective cell movement and Intestinal organoids and Lipopolysaccharide and Organoid fusion and rotation and Rho-associated protein kinase; The method of organoid culture has become a tool widely used in gastrointestinal research, but so far, the migration of organoids derived from gut epithelium and formed in 3D Matrigel matrix has not been reported and studied. The intestinal epithelial tissue derived from 19-day-old chicken embryo was cultured in Matrigel and the dynamic properties of the forming organoids were analyzed by time-lapse image analysis. It was observed that about one in ten organoids actively moved through the matrix, at a speed of 10-20 m/h. Moreover, rotation was observed in the majority of organoids that did not migrate long distances. The fusion events took place between organoids, which collided during the movement or growth. In our previous paper, we showed that the presence of Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 g/ml), increased the mean organoid diameter. Here, we confirm this result and demonstrate that the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (10 M) did not completely abolish organoid migration, but prevented the fusion events, in both LPS-treated and untreated cultures. In consequence, in the presence of Y-27632, the differences between cultures incubated with and without LPS were not visible. We conclude that migration and fusion of organoids may influence their morphology and suggest that these phenomena should be taken into account during the design of experimental settings.","10.1007/s00709-018-1312-3",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5531,"Bovine colon organoids: From 3D bioprinting to cryopreserved multi-well screening platforms.; 3D bioprinting and Bovine enteroid and In-plate cryopreservation organoids and Monolayer culture; Three-dimensional (3D) colon organoids, termed ""colonoids"", derived from adult stem cells represent a powerful tool in in vitro pharmaceutical and toxicological research. Murine and human colonoid models exist. Here we describe the establishment of bovine colonoids for agri-biotechnological applications, and extend the repertoire of colonoid culture options through proof-of-principle for bioprinting and novel in-plate cryopreservation technology. As a first step, we differentiated established long-term bovine colonoid cultures into mature colonoids. Tissue-specific differentiation was demonstrated by gene expression. Second, we investigated cryopreservation of colonoids in situ within an extracellular matrix in multi-well plates. Upon controlled thawing, cryopreserved 3D cultures grew at similar rates to unfrozen colonoids. Cytotoxic sensitivity to staurosporine was not significantly different between in situ freeze-thawed and unfrozen control cultures. Third, scalability of colonoid culture assembly by extrusion bioprinting into multi-well plates using GelMA bioink was assessed. With optimised bioprinting and crosslinking parameters, colonoids in GelMA were printed into 96 well culture plates and remained viable and proliferative post-print. For tissue-relevant in vitro studies we furthermore established differentiated colonoid-derived monolayer cultures on permeable membranes. Taken together, we outline novel in vitro approaches to study the ruminant colonic epithelium and introduce in-plate cryopreservation as convenient alternative to conventional in-vial cryopreservation.","10.1016/j.tiv.2019.104606",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5620,"Acute exposure to deoxynivalenol inhibits porcine enteroid activity via suppression of the Wnt/-catenin pathway.; Deoxynivalenol and Enteroids and Intestinal stem cells and Porcine and Wnt /-catenin pathway; The intake of food containing deoxynivalenol frequently causes damage to the intestine, the renewal of which is driven by intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Nevertheless, the toxicity of deoxynivalenol on ISCs and its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. As pigs are the most sensitive animals to deoxynivalenol, we used piglets for investigation in this study. Here, we show that intestinal epithelial cell activity, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) protein level, and Wnt/-catenin pathway activity were suppressed with acute expose to deoxynivalenol. We further established a novel system for porcine crypt isolation and ex vivo cultivation. Crypts and crypt cells expanded and budded with typical enteroid morphologies under this system. Our results show that both acute in vivo and in vitro administration of deoxynivalenol significantly decreased enteroid activity. Simultaneously, protein levels of -catenin and leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) in enteroids were reduced by deoxynivalenol exposure. In conclusion, we established a reliable culture system for porcine enteroids and demonstrated for the first time that the activity of ISCs and the Wnt/-catenin pathway is sensitively suppressed by acute deoxynivalenol exposure.","10.1016/j.toxlet.2019.01.008",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

We generated cerebral cortex organoids from human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus pluripotent stem cells and sequenced their transcriptomes at weekly time points for comparative analysis. We used transcript structure and expression conservation to discover gene regulatory long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Of 2,975 human, multi-exonic lncRNAs, 2,472 were structurally conserved in at least one other species and 920 were conserved in all. Three hundred eighty-six human lncRNAs were transiently expressed (TrEx) and many were also TrEx in great apes (46%) and rhesus (31%). Many TrEx lncRNAs are expressed in specific cell types by single-cell RNA sequencing. Four TrEx lncRNAs selected based on cell-type specificity, gene structure, and expression pattern conservation were ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells by CRISPRa.

5673,"Zika virus enhances monocyte adhesion and transmigration favoring viral dissemination to neural cells.; NA; Zika virus (ZIKV) invades and persists in the central nervous system (CNS), causing severe neurological diseases. However the virus journey, from the bloodstream to tissues through a mature endothelium, remains unclear. Here, we show that ZIKV-infected monocytes represent suitable carriers for viral dissemination to the CNS using human primary monocytes, cerebral organoids derived from embryonic stem cells, organotypic mouse cerebellar slices, a xenotypic human-zebrafish model, and human fetus brain samples. We find that ZIKV-exposed monocytes exhibit higher expression of adhesion molecules, and higher abilities to attach onto the vessel wall and transmigrate across endothelia. This phenotype is associated to enhanced monocyte-mediated ZIKV dissemination to neural cells. Together, our data show that ZIKV manipulates the monocyte adhesive properties and enhances monocyte transmigration and viral dissemination to neural cells. Monocyte transmigration may represent an important mechanism required for viral tissue invasion and persistence that could be specifically targeted for therapeutic intervention.","10.1038/s41467-019-12408-x",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5700,"Shiga toxin sub-type 2a increases the efficiency of Escherichia coli O157 transmission between animals and restricts epithelial regeneration in bovine enteroids.; NA; Specific Escherichia coli isolates lysogenised with prophages that express Shiga toxin (Stx) can be a threat to human health, with cattle being an important natural reservoir. In many countries the most severe pathology is associated with enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serogroups that express Stx subtype 2a. In the United Kingdom, phage type (PT) 21/28 O157 strains have emerged as the predominant cause of life-threatening EHEC infections and this phage type commonly encodes both Stx2a and Stx2c toxin types. PT21/28 is also epidemiologically linked to super-shedding (>103 cfu/g of faeces) which is significant for inter-animal transmission and human infection as demonstrated using modelling studies. We demonstrate that Stx2a is the main toxin produced by stx2a+/stx2c+ PT21/28 strains induced with mitomycin C and this is associated with more rapid induction of gene expression from the Stx2a-encoding prophage compared to that from the Stx2c-encoding prophage. Bacterial supernatants containing either Stx2a and/or Stx2c were demonstrated to restrict growth of bovine gastrointestinal organoids with no restriction when toxin production was not induced or prevented by mutation. Isogenic strains that differed in their capacity to produce Stx2a were selected for experimental oral colonisation of calves to assess the significance of Stx2a for both super-shedding and transmission between animals. Restoration of Stx2a expression in a PT21/28 background significantly increased animal-to-animal transmission and the number of sentinel animals that became super-shedders. We propose that while both Stx2a and Stx2c can restrict regeneration of the epithelium, it is the relatively rapid and higher levels of Stx2a induction, compared to Stx2c, that have contributed to the successful emergence of Stx2a+ E. coli isolates in cattle in the last 40 years. We propose a model in which Stx2a enhances E. coli O157 colonisation of in-contact animals by restricting regeneration and turnover of the colonised gastrointestinal epithelium.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1008003",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5706,"Dexamethasone Provides Effective Immunosuppression for Improved Survival of Retinal Organoids after Epiretinal Transplantation; NA; We investigated the efficacy of the immunosuppressants rapamycin (RAP) and dexamethasone (DEX) in improving the survival of retinal organoids after epiretinal transplantation. We first compared the immunosuppressive abilities of DEX and RAP in activated microglia in an in vitro setting. Following this, we used immunofluorescence, real-Time polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry to investigate the effects of DEX and RAP on cells in the retinal organoids. Retinal organoids were then seeded onto poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) scaffolds and implanted into rhesus monkey eyes (including a healthy individual and three monkeys with chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) induction) and subjected to different post-operative immunosuppressant treatments; 8 weeks after the experiment, histological examinations were carried out to assess the success of the different treatments. Our in vitro experiments indicated that both DEX and RAP treatments were equally effective in suppressing microglial activity. Although both immunosuppressants altered the morphologies of cells in the retinal organoids and caused a slight decrease in the differentiation of cells into retinal ganglion cells, the organoid cells retained their capacity to grow and differentiate into retinal tissues. Our in vivo experiments indicate that the retinal organoid can survive and differentiate into retinal tissues in a healthy rhesus monkey eye without immunosuppressive treatment. However, the survival and differentiation of these organoids in OHT eyes was successful only with the DEX treatment. RAP treatment was ineffective in preventing immunological rejection, and the retinal organoid failed to survive until the end of 8 weeks. DEX is likely a promising immunosuppressant to enhance the survival of epiretinal implants.","10.1155/2019/7148032",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5708,"IFN-Lambda 3 Mediates Antiviral Protection Against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus by Inducing a Distinct Antiviral Transcript Profile in Porcine Intestinal Epithelia.; PEDV and RNA-seq and enteroids and interferon alpha and interferon-lambda 3; Type III interferon-lambda (IFN-) plays a critical role against infection, particularly in mucosal infection in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Our study and other previous studies have shown that porcine IFN- more efficiently curtails the infection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the intestine epithelia than type I IFN, whereas IFN-3 exerts a more potent effect than IFN-1. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive, and in particular, the transcriptional profile induced by IFN-3 has not been reported. Here, to resolve the mechanism responsible for the disparity between IFN-3 and type I IFN in anti-mucosal virus infection, we compared the transcription profiles induced by the two IFNs in porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells by RNA-Seq. Our results showed that the pretreatment of IPEC-J2 cells with IFN-3 resulted in the differential expression of 983 genes. In contrast, IFN- only modified the expression of 134 genes, and 110 of these genes were also observed in the response to IFN-3. A transcriptional enrichment analysis indicated that IFN-3 or IFN- regulates multiple cellular processes and that IFN-3 activates more robust signaling pathways, particularly the antiviral Jak-STAT signaling pathway, than IFN-. Furthermore, we verified the RNA-Seq results through an RT-qPCR analysis of IPEC-J2 cells and porcine enteroids. Moreover, transient expression of the porcine rsad2 and mx2 genes among the top 10 genes induced by IFN-3 significantly inhibited PEDV infection. Collectively, the data showed that IFN-3 induces a unique transcriptional profile that does not completely overlap with that induced by IFN- and strongly elicits a set of genes responsible for the antiviral activity of IFN-3. These findings provide important knowledge regarding the elicited ISGs of type I and III IFNs in restricting porcine intestinal viral infection.","10.3389/fimmu.2019.02394",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5715,"Generation of Organized Porcine Testicular Organoids in Solubilized Hydrogels from Decellularized Extracellular Matrix.; artificial testis and decellularization and extracellular matrix and fertility preservation and immature testicular tissue and organoids and spermatogonial stem cells and testicular cells and three-dimensional culture; Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue (ITT) prior to chemo/radiotherapy is now ethically accepted and is currently the only way to preserve fertility of prepubertal boys about to undergo cancer therapies. So far, three-dimensional culture of testicular cells isolated from prepubertal human testicular tissue was neither efficient nor reproducible to obtain mature spermatozoa, and ITT transplantation is not a safe option when there is a risk of cancer cell contamination of the testis. Hence, generation of testicular organoids (TOs) after cell selection is a novel strategy aimed at restoring fertility in these patients. Here, we created TOs using hydrogels developed from decellularized porcine ITT and compared cell numbers, organization and function to TOs generated in collagen only hydrogel. Organotypic culture of porcine ITT was used as a control. Rheological and mass spectrometry analyses of both hydrogels highlighted differences in terms of extracellular matrix stiffness and composition, respectively. Sertoli cells (SCs) and germ cells (GCs) assembled into seminiferous tubule-like structures delimited by a basement membrane while Leydig cells (LCs) and peritubular cells localized outside. TOs were maintained for 45 days in culture and secreted stem cell factor and testosterone demonstrating functionality of SCs and LCs, respectively. In both TOs GC numbers decreased and SC numbers increased. However, LC numbers decreased significantly in the collagen hydrogel TOs (p < 0.05) suggesting a better preservation of growth factors within TOs developed from decellularized ITT and thus a better potential to restore the reproductive capacity.","10.3390/ijms20215476",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

The isolation and characterization of normal kidney epithelial stem cells that give rise to dome-forming tubular cells have never been reported. We attempted to isolate and characterize canine kidney epithelial stem cells using a simple cell culture method that we have previously used to isolate other adult human stem cells. Dome-forming kidney epithelial cells were derived from dissociated adult canine kidney tissues that were cultured in a modified keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, nicotinamide, and fetal bovine serum. These cells exhibited high self-renewal capacity in long-term culture (growth for &gt;13 months and 30 cumulative population doublings) and exhibited characteristics of stem cells, including (1) deficiency in gap junctional intercellular communication, (2) anchorage-independent growth, (3) expression of stem cell markers octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2, (4) expression of cell surface markers CD24 and CD133, and (5) multipotent differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and dome-forming tubular cells. Most of these characteristics are shared by the well-known canine renal tubule-derived immortalized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell line. Furthermore, the putative canine kidney stem cells developed in this study formed budding tubule-like organoids on Matrigel and required high cell density (&gt;4,000 cells/cm2) for sustained growth and confluency for dome formation. The signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) phosphorylation inhibitor, AG490, inhibited colony-forming efficiency and dome formation, whereas lipopolysaccharide, an activator of STAT3, increased colony-forming efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that high cell density induces STAT3 expression, which promotes both stem cell self-renewal and differentiation into tubular cells. Our novel cell culture method should be useful for the future development of normal human kidney stem cells for clinical applications and for studying mechanisms of nephrotoxicity.

Although the bovine G6P[5] WC3 strain is an important animal pathogen and is also used in the bovine-human reassortant RotaTeq vaccine, the receptor(s) for the VP8* domain of WC3 and its reassortant strains have not yet been identified. In the present study, HBGA- and saliva-binding assays showed that both G6P[5] WC3 and mono-reassortant G4P[5] strains recognized the Gal HBGA. The infectivity of both P[5]-bearing strains was significantly reduced in Gal-free MA-104 cells by pretreatment with a broadly specific neuraminidase or by coincubation with the 2,6-linked SA-specific Sambucus nigra lectin, but not by the 2,3-linked specific sialidase or by Maackia amurensis lectin. Free NeuAc and the Gal trisaccharide also prevented the infectivity of both strains. This indicated that both P[5]-bearing strains utilize 2,6-linked SA as a ligand on MA104 cells. However, the two strains replicated in differentiated bovine small intestinal enteroids and in their human counterparts that lack 2,6-linked SA or Gal HBGA, suggesting that additional or alternative receptors such as integrins, hsp70, and tight-junction proteins bound directly to the VP5* domain can be used by the P[5]-bearing strains to initiate the infection of human cells. In addition, these data also suggested that P[5]-bearing strains have potential for cross-species transmission.IMPORTANCE Group A rotaviruses initiate infection through the binding of the VP8* domain of the VP4 protein to sialic acids (SAs) or histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Although the bovine G6P[5] WC3 strain is an important animal pathogen and is used as the backbone in the bovine-human reassortant RotaTeq vaccine, the receptor(s) for their P[5] VP8* domain has remained elusive. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrated that the WC3 and bovine-human mono-reassortant G4P[5] vaccine strains recognize both 2,6-linked SA and Gal HBGA as ligands. Neither ligand is expressed on human small intestinal epithelial cells, explaining the absence of natural human infection by P[5]-bearing strains. However, we observed that the P[5]-bearing WC3 and G4P[5] RotaTeq vaccine strains could still infect human intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the four P[5] RotaTeq vaccine strains potentially binding to additional alternative receptors may be efficient and effective in providing protection against severe rotavirus disease in human.","10.1128/jvi.00941-19",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Dog BC resembles human muscle-invasive BC in histopathological characteristics and gene expression profiles, and could be an important research model for this disease. Cancer patient-derived organoid culture can recapitulate organ structures and maintains the gene expression profiles of original tumor tissues. In a previous study, we generated dog prostate cancer organoids using urine samples, however dog BC organoids had never been produced. Therefore we aimed to generate dog BC organoids using urine samples and check their histopathological characteristics, drug sensitivity, and gene expression profiles. Organoids from individual BC dogs were successfully generated, expressed urothelial cell markers (CK7, CK20, and UPK3A) and exhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. In a cell viability assay, the response to combined treatment with a range of anticancer drugs (cisplatin, vinblastine, gemcitabine or piroxicam) was markedly different in each BC organoid. In RNA-sequencing analysis, expression levels of basal cell markers (CK5 and DSG3) and several novel genes (MMP28, CTSE, CNN3, TFPI2, COL17A1, and AGPAT4) were upregulated in BC organoids compared with normal bladder tissues or two-dimensional (2D) BC cell lines. These established dog BC organoids might be a useful tool, not only to determine suitable chemotherapy for BC diseased dogs but also to identify novel biomarkers in human muscle-invasive BC. In the present study, for the 1st time, dog BC organoids were generated and several specifically upregulated organoid genes were identified. Our data suggest that dog BC organoids might become a new tool to provide fresh insights into both dog BC therapy and diagnostic biomarkers.","10.1111/cas.14118",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

We find that the salvage pathway does not affect other major embryonic signaling pathways (Fgf, TGF, Notch, or Shh), thereby demonstrating specificity for Wnt signaling. We show that the role of the salvage pathway in Wnt signaling is evolutionarily conserved in zebrafish and Drosophila. Finally, we show that GlcNAc is essential for the growth of intestinal enteroids, which are highly dependent on Wnt signaling for growth and maintenance. We propose that the Wnt pathway is sensitive to alterations in the glycosylation state of a cell and acts as a nutritional sensor in order to couple growth/proliferation with its metabolic status. We also propose that the clinical manifestations observed in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) in humans may be due, in part, to their effects on Wnt signaling during development.","10.1016/j.mod.2019.03.002",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5830,"The Chick Caudolateral Epiblast Acts as a Permissive Niche for Generating Neuromesodermal Progenitor Behaviours.; Embryonic stem cells and Neuromesodermal progenitors and Presomitic mesoderm; Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMps) are a population of bipotent progenitors that maintain competence to generate both spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm throughout the elongation of the posterior body axis. Recent studies have generated populations of NMp-like cells in culture, which have been shown to differentiate to both neural and mesodermal cell fates when transplanted into either mouse or chick embryos. Here, we aim to compare the potential of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived progenitor populations to generate NMp behaviour against both undifferentiated and differentiated populations. We define NMp behaviour as the ability of cells to: (i) contribute to a significant proportion of the anterior-posterior body axis, (ii) enter into both posterior neural and somitic compartments, and (iii) retain a proportion of the progenitor population within the posterior growth zone. We compare previously identified ES cell-derived NMp-like populations to undifferentiated mouse ES cells and find that they all display similar potentials to generate NMp behaviour in vivo. To assess whether this competence is lost upon further differentiation, we generated anterior and posterior embryonic cell types through the generation of 3D gastruloids and show that NMp competence is lost within the anterior (Brachyury-negative) portion of the gastruloid. Together this suggests that in vitro-derived NMp-like cells maintain an ability to contribute to multiple germ layers that is also present within pluripotent ES cells, rather than acquiring a neuromesodermal competent state through differentiation.","10.1159/000494769",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5909,"Intein-mediated protein trans-splicing expands adeno-associated virus transfer capacity in the retina.; NA; Retinal gene therapy with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors holds promises for treating inherited and noninherited diseases of the eye. Although clinical data suggest that retinal gene therapy is safe and effective, delivery of large genes is hindered by the limited AAV cargo capacity. Protein trans-splicing mediated by split inteins is used by single-cell organisms to reconstitute proteins. Here, we show that delivery of multiple AAV vectors each encoding one of the fragments of target proteins flanked by short split inteins results in protein trans-splicing and full-length protein reconstitution in the retina of mice and pigs and in human retinal organoids. The reconstitution of large therapeutic proteins using this approach improved the phenotype of two mouse models of inherited retinal diseases. Our data support the use of split intein-mediated protein trans-splicing in combination with AAV subretinal delivery for gene therapy of inherited blindness due to mutations in large genes.","10.1126/scitranslmed.aav4523",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
5914,"Morphological and molecular analysis of in vitro tubular structures from bovine yolk sac-derived MSCs; NA; The yolk sac is an extraembryonic membrane, of saccular form, connected to the ventral region of the embryo. It is the main source of nutrition for the embryo during the period when the placenta is not fully formed. The aim of this study was to generate tubular structures using mesenchymal stem cells from the bovine yolk sac (bYS-MSCs) and determine if these structures can be a model for in vitro vasculogenesis. The evaluation of this tissue by histochemistry revealed a strong marking of collagen fibers and PAS technique negativity. In transmission electron microscopy, cytoplasmic organelles with large nuclei were observed. The vessel formation assay on a Matrigel substrate showed that the mesenchymal cells of the yolk sac without growth factors (VEGF) are capable of forming branches, sprouting cells, and tubular structures similar to capillary blood. These tubular structures were xenotransplanted subcutaneously into the mesentery of BALB/c/nude mice; after 45 days, vascularized tissue and extensions of blood vessels around the tubular structures could be observed. Real-time PCR (qPCR) demonstrated an expression of the VEGF gene in different gestational age groups. No difference in distribution or expression was detected among groups. Our results suggest that the spontaneous formation of tubules from the yolk sac can be an experimental model to elucidate initial organogenesis and the possible formation of blood capillaries from in vitro mesenchymal cells and possible route of organoid production.","10.1155/2019/5073745",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

In the Drosophila male germline adult stem cell lineage, germ cells proliferate and progressively differentiate enclosed in supportive somatic cyst cells, forming a small organoid, the functional unit of differentiation. Here we show that cell polarity and vesicle trafficking influence signal transduction in cyst cells, with profound effects on the germ cells they enclose. Our data suggest that the cortical components Dlg, Scrib, Lgl and the clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME)machinery downregulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)signaling. Knockdown of dlg, scrib, lgl, or CME components in cyst cells resulted in germ cell death, similar to increased signal transduction via the EGFR, while lowering EGFR or downstream signaling components rescued the defects. This work provides insights into how cell polarity and endocytosis cooperate to regulate signal transduction and sculpt developing tissues.  2019 The Author(s) In this article, Papagiannouli and colleagues show that Dlg, Scrib, Lgl, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis downregulate EGFR signaling levels in the somatic cyst cells of the Drosophila testis.

PMM2 orthologs are present in model organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene SEC53. Here we describe conserved genotype-phenotype relationships across yeast and human patients between five PMM2 loss-offunction missense mutations and their orthologous SEC53 mutations. These alleles range in severity from folding defective (hypomorph) to dimerization defective (severe hypomorph) to catalytic dead (null). We included the first and second most common missense mutations-R141H, F119L respectively-and the most common compound heterozygote genotype-PMM2R141H/F119L-observed in PMM2-CDG patients. Each mutation described is expressed in haploid as well as homozygous and heterozygous diploid yeast cells at varying protein expression levels as either SEC53 protein variants or PMM2 protein variants. We developed a 384-well-plate, growth-based assay for use in a screen of the 2,560-compound Microsource Spectrum library of approved drugs, experimental drugs, tool compounds and natural products. We identified three compounds that suppress growth defects of SEC53 variants, F126L and V238M, based on the biochemical defect of the allele, protein abundance or ploidy. The rare PMM2 E139K protein variant is fully functional in yeast cells, suggesting that its pathogenicity in humans is due to the underlying DNA mutation that results in skipping of exon 5 and a nonfunctional truncated protein. Together, these results demonstrate that yeast models can be used to characterize known and novel PMM2 patient alleles in quantitative growth and enzymatic activity assays, and used as patient avatars for PMM2-CDG drug screens yielding compounds that could be rapidly cross-validated in zebrafish, rodent and human organoid models.  2019 Chen et al.","10.1534/g3.118.200934",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Organoid culture exploits stem cells' ability to regenerate and produce differentiated epithelium. Intestinal organoid models from rodent or human tissue are widely available whereas large animal models are not. Livestock enteric and zoonotic diseases elicit significant morbidity and mortality in animal and human populations. Therefore, livestock species-specific models may offer novel insights into host-pathogen interactions and disease responses. Bovine and porcine jejunum were obtained from an abattoir and their intestinal crypts isolated, suspended in Matrigel, cultured, cryopreserved and resuscitated. 'Rounding' of crypts occurred followed by budding and then enlargement of the organoids. Epithelial cells were characterised using immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy. Organoids were successfully infected with Toxoplasma gondii or Salmonella typhimurium.

There is an increasing demand to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind diphyodont development through the use of large animal models, since they are the most similar to the mechanism of human tooth development. However, attempting to study diphyodont development in large animals remains challenging due to large tooth size, prolonged growth stage and embryo manipulation. Here, we characterized the expression of possible genes for diphyodont development and odontogenesis of an organoid bud from single cells of tooth germs in vitro using Wzhishan pig strain (WZSP). Following this, we used a method of ectopic transplantation of tooth germs at cap stage to dynamically track diphyodont development of tooth germs in mouse subrenal capsules to overcome the restrictions in pig embryos. The results showed that pig tooth germ at cap stage could restore diphyodont development and maintain efficient long-term survival and growth in mouse subrenal capsules, which is suitable for future manipulation of large mammalian tooth development. Our pilot study provided an alternative for studying diphyodont development in large mammals, which will further promote the use of pig as a diphyodont model similar to humans for craniofacial development study.","10.1242/bio.037036",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

In addition, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at crypt bases are known to play important roles in maintaining the renewal and homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, and the aspects of communication between Glu and ISCs are still unknown. Here, we identify Glu and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as essential regulators of ISC expansion. The results showed that extracellular Glu promoted ISC expansion, indicated by increased intestinal organoid forming efficiency and budding efficiency as well as cell proliferation marker Ki67 immunofluorescence and differentiation marker Keratin 20 (KRT20) expression. Moreover, the insulin receptor (IR) mediating phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and downstream signaling phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway was involved in this response in ISCs. As expected, Glu-induced mTORC1 signaling activation was observed in the intestinal porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2), and Glu activated the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. Accordingly, PI3K inhibition partially suppressed Glu-induced mTORC1 activation. In addition, Glu increased the phosphorylation levels of IR and IRS, and inhibiting IR downregulated the IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway. Collectively, our findings first indicate that extracellular Glu activates mTORC1 via the IR/IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway and stimulates ISC expansion, providing a new perspective for regulating the growth and health of the intestinal epithelium.","10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03626",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6060,"Human Serum Albumin Is an Essential Component of the Host Defense Mechanism Against Clostridium difficile Intoxication.; NA; BACKGROUND: The pathogenic effects of Clostridium difficile are primarily attributable to the production of the large protein toxins (C difficile toxins [Tcd]) A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). These toxins monoglucosylate Rho GTPases in the cytosol of host cells, causing destruction of the actin cytoskeleton with cytotoxic effects. Low human serum albumin (HSA) levels indicate a higher risk of acquiring and developing a severe C difficile infection (CDI) and are associated with recurrent and fatal disease. METHODS: We used a combined approach based on docking simulation and biochemical analyses that were performed in vitro on purified proteins and in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), and in vivo on stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids and zebrafish embryos. RESULTS: Our results show that HSA specifically binds via its domain II to TcdA and TcdB and thereby induces their autoproteolytic cleavage at physiological concentrations. This process impairs toxin internalization into the host cells and reduces the toxin-dependent glucosylation of Rho proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence for a specific HSA-dependent self-defense mechanism against C difficile toxins and provide an explanation for the clinical correlation between CDI severity and hypoalbuminemia.","10.1093/infdis/jiy338",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6067,"Evolution of Cortical Neurogenesis in Amniotes Controlled by Robo Signaling Levels.; Notch and Pax6 and Tbr2 and electroporation and evolution and intermediate progenitor and microcephaly and radial glia; Cerebral cortex size differs dramatically between reptiles, birds, and mammals, owing to developmental differences in neuron production. In mammals, signaling pathways regulating neurogenesis have been identified, but genetic differences behind their evolution across amniotes remain unknown. We show that direct neurogenesis from radial glia cells, with limited neuron production, dominates the avian, reptilian, and mammalian paleocortex, whereas in the evolutionarily recent mammalian neocortex, most neurogenesis is indirect via basal progenitors. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mouse, chick, and snake embryos and in human cerebral organoids demonstrate that high Slit/Robo and low Dll1 signaling, via Jag1 and Jag2, are necessary and sufficient to drive direct neurogenesis. Attenuating Robo signaling and enhancing Dll1 in snakes and birds recapitulates the formation of basal progenitors and promotes indirect neurogenesis. Our study identifies modulation in activity levels of conserved signaling pathways as a primary mechanism driving the expansion and increased complexity of the mammalian neocortex during amniote evolution.","10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.007",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

To optimize for Ca2+-dependent photoacoustic signal changes, we synthesized a selective metallochromic sensor with high extinction coefficient, low quantum yield, and high photobleaching resistance. Micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ lead to a robust blueshift of the absorbance of CaSPA, which translated into an accompanying decrease of the peak photoacoustic signal. The acetoxymethyl esterified sensor variant was readily taken up by cells without toxic effects and thus allowed us for the first time to perform live imaging of Ca2+ fluxes in genetically unmodified cells and heart organoids as well as in zebrafish larval brain via combined fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging.","10.1021/jacs.7b03064",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Despite increasing treatment options for this disease, prognosis remains poor. CRIPTO (TDGF1) protein is expressed at high levels in several human tumours and promotes oncogenic phenotype. Its expression has been correlated to poor prognosis in HCC. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the basis for the effects of CRIPTO in HCC. We investigated CRIPTO expression levels in three cohorts of clinical cirrhotic and HCC specimens. We addressed the role of CRIPTO in hepatic tumourigenesis using Cre-loxP-controlled lentiviral vectors expressing CRIPTO in cell line-derived xenografts. Responses to standard treatments (sorafenib, doxorubicin) were assessed directly on xenograft-derived ex vivo tumour slices. CRIPTO-overexpressing patient-derived xenografts were established and used for ex vivo drug response assays. The effects of sorafenib and doxorubicin treatment in combination with a CRIPTO pathway inhibitor were tested in ex vivo cultures of xenograft models and 3D cultures. CRIPTO protein was found highly expressed in human cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma specimens but not in those of healthy participants. Stable overexpression of CRIPTO in human HepG2 cells caused epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, increased expression of cancer stem cell markers, and enhanced cell proliferation and migration. HepG2-CRIPTO cells formed tumours when injected into immune-compromised mice, whereas HepG2 cells lacking stable CRIPTO overexpression did not. High-level CRIPTO expression in xenograft models was associated with resistance to sorafenib, which could be modulated using a CRIPTO pathway inhibitor in ex vivo tumour slices. Our data suggest that a subgroup of CRIPTO-expressing HCC patients may benefit from a combinatorial treatment scheme and that sorafenib resistance may be circumvented by inhibition of the CRIPTO pathway.

Intestinal organoids that mimic the intestinal tissue have attracted attention in regenerative medicine and drug development. In this study, we generated intestinal organoids from CM induced pluripotent stem (CMiPS) cells and analyzed their pharmacokinetic functions. CMiPS cells were induced into the hindgut; then, the cells were seeded on microfabricated culture vessel plates to form spheroids. The resulting floating spheroids were differentiated into intestinal organoids in a medium containing small-molecule compounds. The mRNA expression of intestinal markers and pharmacokinetic-related genes was markedly increased in the presence of small-molecule compounds. The organoids possessed a polarized epithelium and contained various cells constituting small intestinal tissues. The intestinal organoids formed functional tight junctions and expressed drug transporter proteins. In addition, in the organoids generated, cytochrome P450 3A8 (CYP3A8) activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitor ketoconazole and was induced by rifampicin.

Previous reports examining neural progenitor tropism of ZIKV in organoid and animal models did not address whether the virus infects all neural progenitors uniformly. To explore this, ZIKV was injected into the neural tube of 2-day-old chicken embryos, resulting in nonuniform periventricular infection 3 days later. Recurrent foci of intense infection were present at specific signaling centers that influence neuroepithelial patterning at a distance through secretion of morphogens. ZIKV infection reduced transcript levels for 3 morphogens, SHH, BMP7, and FGF8 expressed at the midbrain basal plate, hypothalamic floor plate, and isthmus, respectively. Levels of Patched1, a SHH-pathway downstream gene, were also reduced, and a SHH-dependent cell population in the ventral midbrain was shifted in position. Thus, the diminishment of signaling centers through ZIKV-mediated apoptosis may yield broader, non-cell-autonomous changes in brain patterning.","10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.080",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

However, its implication in neuronal death is still unclear. Here, we show that spatacsin, which is required for lysosome recycling and whose loss of function leads to hereditary spastic paraplegia 11 (SPG11), promotes clearance of gangliosides from lysosomes in mouse and human SPG11 models. We demonstrate that spatacsin acts downstream of clathrin and recruits dynamin to allow lysosome membrane recycling and clearance of gangliosides from lysosomes. Gangliosides contributed to the accumulation of autophagy markers in lysosomes and to neuronal death. In contrast, decreasing ganglioside synthesis prevented neurodegeneration and improved motor phenotype in a SPG11 zebrafish model. Our work reveals how inhibition of lysosome membrane recycling leads to the deleterious accumulation of gangliosides, linking lysosome recycling to neurodegeneration.","10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.098",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

We show that an AAV9 variant provides efficient foveal cone transduction when injected into the subretinal space several millimeters away from the fovea, without detaching this delicate region. An engineered AAV2 variant provides gene delivery to foveal cones with a well-tolerated dose administered intravitreally. Both delivery modalities rely on a cone-specific promoter and result in high-level transgene expression compatible with optogenetic vision restoration.

Inactivating both aPKC kinase activity and the Pak1 kinase leads to a complete loss of epithelial polarity and morphology, with cells losing markers of apical polarization such as Crumbs, Par3/Bazooka, or ZO-1.

Methods: Thirty healthy rhesus monkeys were infused with -amanitin and lipopolysaccharide and randomized into five groups (ALF alone control group; sham no-cell SRBAL treatment group; groups A, B and C with SRBAL treatment started at 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after induction of ALF, respectively). Animals were continuously treated with the SRBAL device for 6 h and followed for up to 336 h. Results: Survival of ALF monkeys improved with hepatocyte SRBAL treatment compared to control groups. Blood ammonia and total bilirubin were lower, and albumin levels were higher in all hepatocyte SRBAL treatment groups. No evidence of porcine endogenous retrovirus was identified in monkey liver or blood after SRBAL treatment. Titers of monkey antibody (IgG, IgM) did not rise after SRBAL treatment. In survival cases, the proportion of necrotic and apoptotic hepatocytes was lower in SRBAL-treated groups, with earlier liver regeneration leading to recovery. Cytokines TNF-, IL-6, IL-12, IL-1, IL-8, IFN- and IL-2 were ameliorated by the SRBAL treatment, while levels of M-CSF; HGF, EGF and VEGF; IL-1RA and MIF rose on priming, proliferation and the late phase of liver regeneration. Conclusions: The benefit of SRBAL therapy included preventive effects and therapeutic effects. SRBAL improved survival rate and prolonged median survival time in a nonhuman primate model of drug-induced ALF, and these benefits declined with a delay in the initiation of therapy. Improved survival and recovery of ALF monkeys was associated with a reduction in blood ammonia levels, inhibition of the pro-inflammatory response of ALF, and provided a microenvironment more suitable for regeneration of the injured liver.","10.7150/thno.26540",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Pigs are commonly fed high-fiber diets to reduce production costs and non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)-degrading enzymes have been used to increase fiber digestibility. We evaluated the expression of mucin 2 (MUC2), presence of goblet cells, and ileal immune profile of pigs housed individually for 28 days and fed either a low fiber diet based on corn-soybean meal (CSB, n = 9), or two high fiber diets formulated adding 40% corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS, n = 9) or 30% wheat middlings (WM, n = 9) to CSB-based diet.

Feeding DDGS and WM diets increased ileal MUC2 expression compared with CSB diet, and this effect was reversed by the addition of enzymes. There were no differences in abundance of goblet cells among treatments. In general, enzyme supplementation increased gene expression and concentrations of IL-1, and reduced the concentrations of IL-4, IL-17A and IL-11.

In accordance with previous studies, treatment with Il-4 induced Muc2 and expansion of goblet cells in mouse enteroids. However, swine enteroids did not change MUC2 expression or number of goblet cells when treated with IL-4 or IL-1.

DESIGN: Primary and secondary follicles were cultured in a matrix-free system and were assigned to the control group and the group with AMH supplementation during the preantral stage and neutralizing AMH antibody addition during the antral stage. SETTING: National primate research center. ANIMAL(S): Adult, female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Follicle survival, growth, steroid and paracrine factor production, and oocyte competence were evaluated. Follicles were assessed for expression of genes that are critical for gonadotropin signaling, cumulus cell glycolysis, and oocyte quality. RESULT(S): Primary follicles formed ""organoids"" and developed to the antral stage in group culture. AMH exposure during the preantral stage increased organoid diameters. Oocytes from the AMH-treated organoids had greater diameters and matured to the metaphase II (MII) stage. Secondary follicles developed to the antral stage during individual culture. The AMH exposure during the preantral stage and AMH antibody treatment during the antral stage increased follicle diameters, vascular endothelial growth factor and follistatin production, differentiation factor 9 expression, and oocyte diameters.

6446,"Wnt/PCP controls spreading of Wnt/-catenin signals by cytonemes in vertebrates.; Wnt signaling and cell biology and cytonemes and developmental biology and patterning and protein trafficking and signalling and signalling filopodia and zebrafish; Signaling filopodia, termed cytonemes, are dynamic actin-based membrane structures that regulate the exchange of signaling molecules and their receptors within tissues. However, how cytoneme formation is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) autocrine signaling controls the emergence of cytonemes, and that cytonemes subsequently control paracrine Wnt/-catenin signal activation. Upon binding of the Wnt family member Wnt8a, the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 becomes activated. Ror2/PCP signaling leads to the induction of cytonemes, which mediate the transport of Wnt8a to neighboring cells. In the Wnt-receiving cells, Wnt8a on cytonemes triggers Wnt/-catenin-dependent gene transcription and proliferation. We show that cytoneme-based Wnt transport operates in diverse processes, including zebrafish development, murine intestinal crypt and human cancer organoids, demonstrating that Wnt transport by cytonemes and its control via the Ror2 pathway is highly conserved in vertebrates.","10.7554/elife.36953",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6451,"Optimized procedures for generating an enhanced, near physiological 2D culture system from porcine intestinal organoids.; Epithelium and Intestinal and Monolayer and Organoids and Porcine; An important practical limitation of the three-dimensional geometry of stem-cell derived intestinal organoids is that it prevents easy access to the apical epithelium for testing food components, microorganisms, bioactive and toxic compounds. To this end, we here report on a new robust method for generating confluent intestinal cell monolayers from single-cell suspensions of enzymatically-dissociated porcine organoids using modified culture conditions. With this method, cell seeding densities can be standardised, overcoming problems with methods based on mechanical dissociation of organoids. Confluent monolayers formed tight junctions with high transepithelial electrical resistance in three days and could be used in experiments for up to two weeks. Multilineage differentiation of ileal stem cells was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR of cell-specific transcripts, also unequivocally confirming the controversial existence of Paneth-like cells in the porcine small intestine. The method described here is useful to standardize primary epithelial monolayer formation from intestinal organoids and allows rapid and robust studies of intestinal physiology.","10.1016/j.scr.2018.02.013",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6468,"Establishment and characterization of a canine keratinocyte organoid culture system.; NA; BACKGROUND: Perturbations of epidermal and follicular homeostasis have been attributed to a variety of skin diseases affecting dogs. The availability of an in vitro system to investigate these diseases is important to understand underlying pathomechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To establish an accurate and reliable in vitro 3D system of canine keratinocyte organoids to lay the basis for studying functional defects in interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis, reconstitution and differentiation that lead to alopecic and epidermal diseases. ANIMALS: Skin biopsies were obtained from freshly euthanized dogs of different breeds with no skin abnormalities. METHODS: Cells derived from microdissected IFE and HFs were seeded in Matrigel and keratinocyte organoids were grown and characterized using immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Both organoid lines develop into a basal IFE-like cell type. Gene and protein expression analysis revealed high mRNA and protein levels of keratins 5 and 14, IFE differentiation markers and intercellular molecules. Key markers of HF stem cells were lacking. Withdrawal of growth factors resulted in upregulation of markers such as KRT16, Involucrin, KRT17 and SOX9, showing the potential of the organoids to develop towards more differentiated tissue. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Our 3D in vitro culture system provides the basis to explore epidermal function, to investigate the culture conditions necessary for the development of organoids with a HF signature and to address cutaneous disorders in dogs. However, for induction of HF signatures or hair growth, addition of different growth factors or co-culture with dermal papilla will be required.","10.1111/vde.12541",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6492,"Oxidative Stress in Cells with Extra Centrosomes Drives Non-Cell-Autonomous Invasion.; HER2 and IL-8 and ROS and cancer and centrosome amplification and invasion and paracrine signaling and secretion and senescence; Centrosomal abnormalities, in particular centrosome amplification, are recurrent features of human tumors. Enforced centrosome amplification in vivo plays a role in tumor initiation and progression. However, centrosome amplification occurs only in a subset of cancer cells, and thus, partly due to this heterogeneity, the contribution of centrosome amplification to tumors is unknown. Here, we show that supernumerary centrosomes induce a paracrine-signaling axis via the secretion of proteins, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), which leads to non-cell-autonomous invasion in 3D mammary organoids and zebrafish models. This extra centrosomes-associated secretory phenotype (ECASP) promotes invasion of human mammary cells via HER2 signaling activation. Further, we demonstrate that centrosome amplification induces an early oxidative stress response via increased NOX-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn mediates secretion of pro-invasive factors. The discovery that cells with extra centrosomes can manipulate the surrounding cells highlights unexpected and far-reaching consequences of these abnormalities in cancer.","10.1016/j.devcel.2018.10.026",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6514,"Development of in vitro enteroids derived from bovine small intestinal crypts.; NA; Cattle are an economically important domestic animal species. In vitro 2D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells or epithelial cell lines have been widely used to study cell function and host-pathogen interactions in the bovine intestine. However, these cultures lack the cellular diversity encountered in the intestinal epithelium, and the physiological relevance of monocultures of transformed cell lines is uncertain. Little is also known of the factors that influence cell differentiation and homeostasis in the bovine intestinal epithelium, and few cell-specific markers that can distinguish the different intestinal epithelial cell lineages have been reported. Here we describe a simple and reliable procedure to establish in vitro 3D enteroid, or ""mini gut"", cultures from bovine small intestinal (ileal) crypts. These enteroids contained a continuous central lumen lined with a single layer of polarized enterocytes, bound by tight junctions with abundant microvilli on their apical surfaces. Histological and transcriptional analyses suggested that the enteroids comprised a mixed population of intestinal epithelial cell lineages including intestinal stem cells, enterocytes, Paneth cells, goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells. We show that bovine enteroids can be successfully maintained long-term through multiple serial passages without observable changes to their growth characteristics, morphology or transcriptome. Furthermore, the bovine enteroids can be cryopreserved and viable cultures recovered from frozen stocks. Our data suggest that these 3D bovine enteroid cultures represent a novel, physiologically-relevant and tractable in vitro system in which epithelial cell differentiation and function, and host-pathogen interactions in the bovine small intestine can be studied.","10.1186/s13567-018-0547-5",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6530,"Advanced three-dimensional culture of equine intestinal epithelial stem cells.; 3D culture and enteroid and horse and intestine and organoid and stem cell; BACKGROUND: Intestinal epithelial stem cells are critical to epithelial repair following gastrointestinal injury. The culture of intestinal stem cells has quickly become a cornerstone of a vast number of new research endeavours that range from determining tissue viability to testing drug efficacy for humans. This study aims to describe the methods of equine stem cell culture and highlights the future benefits of these techniques for the advancement of equine medicine. OBJECTIVES: To describe the isolation and culture of small intestinal stem cells into three-dimensional (3D) enteroids in horses without clinical gastrointestinal abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. METHODS: Intestinal samples were collected by sharp dissection immediately after euthanasia. Intestinal crypts containing intestinal stem cells were dissociated from the underlying tissue layers, plated in a 3D matrix and supplemented with growth factors. After several days, resultant 3D enteroids were prepared for immunofluorescent imaging and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to detect and characterise specific cell types present. Intestinal crypts were cryopreserved immediately following collection and viability assessed. RESULTS: Intestinal crypts were successfully cultured and matured into 3D enteroids containing a lumen and budding structures. Immunofluorescence and PCR were used to confirm the existence of stem cells and all post mitotic, mature cell types, described to exist in the horse intestinal epithelium. Previously frozen crypts were successfully cultured following a freeze-thaw cycle. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Tissues were all derived from normal horses. Application of this technique for the study of specific disease was not performed at this time. CONCLUSIONS: The successful culture of equine intestinal crypts into 3D ""mini-guts"" allows for in vitro studies of the equine intestine. Additionally, these results have relevance to future development of novel therapies that harness the regenerative potential of equine intestine in horses with gastrointestinal disease (colic).","10.1111/evj.12734",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

By comparing these with two long-read de novo human genome assemblies and a gorilla genome assembly, we characterized lineage-specific and shared great ape genetic variation ranging from single- to mega-base pair-sized variants. We identified ~17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman apes.

6595,"The formation of intestinal organoids in a hanging drop culture; NA; Recently organoids have become widely used in vitro models of many tissue and organs. These type of structures, originated from embryonic or adult mammalian intestines, are called ""mini guts"". They organize spontaneously when intestinal crypts or stem cells are embedded in the extracellular matrix proteins preparation scaffold (Matrigel). This approach has some disadvantages, as Matrigel is undefined (the concentrations of growth factors and other biologically active components in it may vary from batch to batch), difficult to handle and expensive. Here we show that the organoids derived from chicken embryo intestine are formed in a hanging drop without embedding, providing an attractive alternative for currently used protocols. Using this technique we obtained compact structures composed of contiguous organoids, which were generally similar to chicken organoids cultured in Matrigel in terms of morphology and expression of intestinal epithelial markers.

6637,"Culture and characterization of chicken small intestinal crypts.; NA; The integrity and normal function of the small intestinal epithelium depends critically on the rapid renewal of epithelial cells from basal stem cells. The intensive proliferation that fuels this self-renewal process is confined to the intestinal crypts. Establishment of suitable protocols for crypt isolation and culture is pivotal for the studies of intestinal self-renewal mechanisms. In this study, chicken small intestinal crypts were isolated, purified, and further cultured in a Matrigel 3-D culture system. The growth factor concentration assay on the fourth d of culture showed that Group C (50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 100 ng/mL Noggin, and 500 ng/mL R-spondin 1) supplement in culture medium could significantly enlarge the diameter of organoids when compared with Group A (5 ng/mL EGF, 10 ng/mL Noggin, 50 ng/mL, and R-spondin 1) and Group B (10 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL Noggin, and 100 ng/mL R-spondin 1) by 188.4% (P = 0.026) and 176.9% (P = 0.034), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy, neutral red staining, and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation demonstrated the integrated structure, high viability, and proliferative activity in cultured chicken intestinal organoids.

6641,"Intestinal Stem Cell Isolation and Culture in a Porcine Model of Segmental Small Intestinal Ischemia.; NA; Intestinal ischemia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary patients. Many disease processes result in intestinal ischemia, when the blood supply and therefore oxygen is decreased to the intestine. This leads to intestinal barrier loss and damage to the underlying tissue. Intestinal stem cells reside at the base of the crypts of Lieberkhn and are responsible for intestinal renewal during homeostasis and following injury. Ex vivo cell culture techniques have allowed for the successful study of epithelial stem cell interactions by establishing culture conditions that support the growth of three-dimensional epithelial organ-like systems (termed ""enteroids"" and ""colonoids"" from the small and large intestine, respectively). These enteroids are composed of crypt and villus-like domains and mature to contain all of the cell types found within the epithelium. Historically, murine models have been utilized to study intestinal injury. However, a porcine model offers several advantages including similarity of size as well as gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology to that of humans. By utilizing a porcine model, we establish a protocol in which segmental loops of intestinal ischemia can be created within a single animal, enabling the study of differing time points of ischemic injury and repair in vivo. Additionally, we describe a method to isolate and culture the intestinal stem cells from the ischemic loops of intestine, allowing for the continued study of epithelial repair, modulated by stem cells, ex vivo.","10.3791/57647",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Their physical similarities with humans enable the use of surgical procedures and treatment approaches used for patients, which facilitates clinical translation. Here, we aimed to develop an inducible oncopig model of intestinal cancer. Transgenic (TG) minipigs were generated using somatic cell nuclear transfer by handmade cloning. The pigs encode two TG cassettes: (a) an Flp recombinase-inducible oncogene cassette containing KRAS-G12D, cMYC, SV40LT - which inhibits p53 - and pRB and (b) a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible Flp recombinase activator cassette controlled by the intestinal epithelium-specific villin promoter. Thirteen viable transgenic minipigs were born. The ability of 4-OHT to activate the oncogene cassette was confirmed in vitro in TG colonic organoids and ex vivo in tissue biopsies obtained by colonoscopy. In order to provide proof of principle that the oncogene cassette could also successfully be activated in vivo, three pigs were perorally treated with 400 mg tamoxifen for 2  5 days. After two months, one pig developed a duodenal neuroendocrine carcinoma with a lymph node metastasis. Molecular analysis of the carcinoma and metastasis confirmed activation of the oncogene cassette. No tumor formation was observed in untreated TG pigs or in the remaining two treated pigs. The latter indicates that tamoxifen delivery can probably be improved. In summary, we have generated a novel inducible oncopig model of intestinal cancer, which has the ability to form metastatic disease already two months after induction. The model may be helpful in bridging the gap between basic research and clinical usage. It opens new venues for longitudinal studies of tumor development and evolution, for preclinical assessment of new anticancer regimens, for pharmacology and toxicology assessments, as well as for studies into biological mechanisms of tumor formation and metastasis.","10.1002/1878-0261.12136",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Mechanism underlying these phenomena and their diversity among vertebrates can be studied in 3D organoid cultures. We investigated the growth of chicken embryo intestinal epithelial organoids in Matrigel with and without Toll-like receptors (TLRs) stimulation. The organoid cultures contained also some myofibroblasts with potential to promote intestinal stem cell survival. Organoid cells, expressing TLR4, TLR2 type 1 and TLR2 type 2 were incubated with their agonists (lipopolysaccharide - LPS and Pam3CSK4) or co-cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria (LA-5). Pam3CSK4 and LA-5 promoted organoid growth, which was demonstrated by comparing the morphological parameters (mean number and area of organoids). The profile of prostaglandins (PG), known to promote intestinal regeneration, in supernatants from organoid and fibroblast cultures were evaluated. Both PGE(2) and PGD(2) were detected. As compared to unstimulated controls, supernatants from the Pam3CSK4-stimulated organoids contained twice as much of PGE(2) and PGD(2).

Stem cell-derived 3-D organoid culture could recapitulate organ structures and physiology. Using patient tissues, a human PC organoid culture system was established. Recent study has shown that urine cells also possess the characteristic of stem cells. However, urine cell-derived PC organoids have never been produced. Therefore, we generated PC organoids using the dog urine samples. Urine organoids were successfully generated from each dog with PC. Each organoid showed cystic structures and resembled the epithelial structures of original tissues. Expression of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and a myofibloblast marker, alpha-SMA, was observed in the urine organoids. The organoids also expressed a basal cell marker, CK5, and a luminal cell marker, CK8. CD49f-sorted basal cell organoids rapidly grew compared with CD24-sorted luminal cell organoids. The population of CD44-positive cells was the highest in both organoids and the original urine cells. Tumors were successfully formed with the injection of the organoids into immunodeficient mice. Treatment with a microtubule inhibitor, docetaxel, but not a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, piroxicam, and an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, decreased the cell viability of organoids. Treatment with a Hedgehog signal inhibitor, GANT61, increased the radiosensitivity in the organoids.

6864,"Class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase controls epithelial integrity through endosomal LKB1 regulation.; NA; The molecular mechanisms underlying the interdependence between intracellular trafficking and epithelial cell polarity are poorly understood. Here we show that inactivation of class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (CIII-PI3K), which produces phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) on endosomes, disrupts epithelial organization. This is caused by dysregulation of endosomally localized Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as STK11), which shows delocalized and increased activity accompanied by dysplasia-like growth and invasive behaviour of cells provoked by JNK pathway activation. CIII-PI3K inactivation cooperates with Ras(V12) to promote tumour growth in vivo in an LKB1-dependent manner. Strikingly, co-depletion of LKB1 reverts these phenotypes and restores epithelial integrity. The endosomal, but not autophagic, function of CIII-PI3K controls polarity. We identify the CIII-PI3K effector, WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing 2 (WDFY2), as an LKB1 regulator in Drosophila tissues and human organoids.

Here we report findings of a series of experiments to establish increased longevity, as monitored by culture transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and concurrent histological developments. Experimental cultures improved TEER during apical freshwater exposure for a mean of twelve days, compared to previous viabilities of up to 3 days. Cultures with larger surface areas and the use of trout serum rather than foetal bovine serum (FBS) contributed to the improvement, while perfusion of the intact gill prior to cell harvest resulted in a significantly faster preparation. Detailed scanning electron microscopy analysis of cultures revealed diverse surface structures that changed with culture age. Cultures grown on membranes with an increased porosity, collagen coating or 3D structure were of no benefit compared to standard membranes.

One of the hallmarks of NAFLD, hepatic steatosis, is a common feature in canine congenital portosystemic shunts. The aim of this study was to gain detailed insight into the pathogenesis of steatosis in this large animal model. Hepatic lipid accumulation, gene-expression analysis and HPLC-MS of neutral lipids and phospholipids in extrahepatic (EHPSS) and intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) was compared to healthy control dogs. Liver organoids of diseased dogs and healthy control dogs were incubated with palmitic- and oleic-acid, and lipid accumulation was quantified using LD540. In histological slides of shunt livers, a 12-fold increase of lipid content was detected compared to the control dogs (EHPSS P<0.01; IHPSS P = 0.042). Involvement of lipid-related genes to steatosis in portosystemic shunting was corroborated using gene-expression profiling. Lipid analysis demonstrated different triglyceride composition and a shift towards short chain and omega-3 fatty acids in shunt versus healthy dogs, with no difference in lipid species composition between shunt types. All organoids showed a similar increase in triacylglycerols after free fatty acids enrichment. This study demonstrates that steatosis is probably secondary to canine portosystemic shunts.

Spontaneously occurring cancers in dogs contain a diversity of cells that like for human tumors suggest that certain canine tumors are also generated from cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs, like normal SCs, have the capacity for self-renewal as mammospheres in suspension cultures. To understand how cells with SC properties contribute to canine mammary gland tumor development and progression, comparative analysis between normal SCs and CSCs, obtained from the same individual, is essential. We have utilized the property of sphere formation to develop culture conditions for propagating stem/progenitor cells from canine normal and tumor tissue. We show that cells from dissociated mammospheres retain sphere reformation capacity for several serial passages and have the capacity to generate organoid structures ex situ. Utilizing various culture conditions for passaging SCs and CSCs, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were found to positively or negatively regulate mammosphere regeneration, organoid formation, and multi-lineage differentiation potential. The response of FGF2 and EGF on SCs and CSCs was different, with increased FGF2 and EGF self-renewal promoted in SCs and repressed in CSCs.

6887,"Control of intestinal stem cell function and proliferation by mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism.; NA; Most differentiated cells convert glucose to pyruvate in the cytosol through glycolysis, followed by pyruvate oxidation in the mitochondria. These processes are linked by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which is required for efficient mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. In contrast, proliferative cells, including many cancer and stem cells, perform glycolysis robustly but limit fractional mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. We sought to understand the role this transition from glycolysis to pyruvate oxidation plays in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Loss of the MPC in Lgr5-EGFP-positive stem cells, or treatment of intestinal organoids with an MPC inhibitor, increases proliferation and expands the stem cell compartment. Similarly, genetic deletion of the MPC in Drosophila intestinal stem cells also increases proliferation, whereas MPC overexpression suppresses stem cell proliferation. These data demonstrate that limiting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is necessary and sufficient to maintain the proliferation of intestinal stem cells.","10.1038/ncb3593",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6904,"Porcine Esophageal Submucosal Gland Culture Model Shows Capacity for Proliferation and Differentiation.; NA; BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although cells comprising esophageal submucosal glands (ESMGs) represent a potential progenitor cell niche, new models are needed to understand their capacity to proliferate and differentiate. By histologic appearance, ESMGs have been associated with both overlying normal squamous epithelium and columnar epithelium. Our aim was to assess ESMG proliferation and differentiation in a 3-dimensional culture model. METHODS: We evaluated proliferation in human ESMGs from normal and diseased tissue by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry. Next, we compared 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine labeling in porcine ESMGs in vivo before and after esophageal injury with a novel in vitro porcine organoid ESMG model. Microarray analysis of ESMGs in culture was compared with squamous epithelium and fresh ESMGs. RESULTS: Marked proliferation was observed in human ESMGs of diseased tissue. This activated ESMG state was recapitulated after esophageal injury in an in vivo porcine model, ESMGs assumed a ductal appearance with increased proliferation compared with control. Isolated and cultured porcine ESMGs produced buds with actively cycling cells and passaged to form epidermal growth factor-dependent spheroids. These spheroids were highly proliferative and were passaged multiple times. Two phenotypes of spheroids were identified: solid squamous (P63+) and hollow/ductal (cytokeratin 7+). Microarray analysis showed spheroids to be distinct from parent ESMGs and enriched for columnar transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the activated ESMG state, seen in both human disease and our porcine model, may provide a source of cells to repopulate damaged epithelium in a normal manner (squamous) or abnormally (columnar epithelium). This culture model will allow the evaluation of factors that drive ESMGs in the regeneration of injured epithelium. The raw microarray data have been uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number: GSE100543).","10.1016/j.jcmgh.2017.07.005",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
6979,"Self-organising aggregates of zebrafish retinal cells for investigating mechanisms of neural lamination.; Cell sorting and Layer formation and Mller cells and Organoid and Reaggregation and SoFa; To investigate the cell-cell interactions necessary for the formation of retinal layers, we cultured dissociated zebrafish retinal progenitors in agarose microwells. Within these wells, the cells re-aggregated within hours, forming tight retinal organoids. Using a Spectrum of Fates zebrafish line, in which all different types of retinal neurons show distinct fluorescent spectra, we found that by 48h in culture, the retinal organoids acquire a distinct spatial organisation, i.e. they became coarsely but clearly laminated. Retinal pigment epithelium cells were in the centre, photoreceptors and bipolar cells were next most central and amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells were on the outside. Image analysis allowed us to derive quantitative measures of lamination, which we then used to find that Mller glia, but not RPE cells, are essential for this process.","10.1242/dev.142760",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
7008,"Pharmaceutical Metabolism in Fish: Using a 3-D Hepatic In Vitro Model to Assess Clearance.; NA; At high internal doses, pharmaceuticals have the potential for inducing biological/pharmacological effects in fish. One particular concern for the environment is their potential to bioaccumulate and reach pharmacological levels; the study of these implications for environmental risk assessment has therefore gained increasing attention. To avoid unnecessary testing on animals, in vitro methods for assessment of xenobiotic metabolism could aid in the ecotoxicological evaluation. Here we report the use of a 3-D in vitro liver organoid culture system (spheroids) derived from rainbow trout to measure the metabolism of seven pharmaceuticals using a substrate depletion assay. Of the pharmaceuticals tested, propranolol, diclofenac and phenylbutazone were metabolised by trout liver spheroids; atenolol, metoprolol, diazepam and carbamazepine were not. Substrate depletion kinetics data was used to estimate intrinsic hepatic clearance by this spheroid model, which was similar for diclofenac and approximately 5 fold higher for propranolol when compared to trout liver microsomal fraction (S9) data. These results suggest that liver spheroids could be used as a relevant and metabolically competent in vitro model with which to measure the biotransformation of pharmaceuticals in fish; and propranolol acts as a reproducible positive control.","10.1371/journal.pone.0168837",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
7016,"Epidermal growth factor suppresses intestinal epithelial cell shedding through a MAPK-dependent pathway.; Cell shedding and EGFR and Epidermal growth factor receptor and Epithelial cell and Inflammatory bowel disease and Intestinal epithelium and MAP kinases and MAPKs; Cell shedding from the intestinal villus is a key element of tissue turnover that is essential to maintain health and homeostasis. However, the signals regulating this process are not well understood. We asked whether shedding is controlled by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an important driver of intestinal growth and differentiation. In 3D ileal enteroid culture and cell culture models (MDCK, IEC-6 and IPEC-J2 cells), extrusion events were suppressed by EGF, as determined by direct counting of released cells or rhodamine-phalloidin labeling of condensed actin rings. Blockade of the MEK-ERK pathway, but not other downstream pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or protein kinase C (PKC), reversed EGF inhibition of shedding. These effects were not due to a change in cell viability. Furthermore, EGF-driven MAPK signaling inhibited both caspase-independent and -dependent shedding pathways. Similar results were found in vivo, in a novel zebrafish model for intestinal epithelial shedding. Taken together, the data show that EGF suppresses cell shedding in the intestinal epithelium through a selective MAPK-dependent pathway affecting multiple extrusion mechanisms. EGFR signaling might be a therapeutic target for disorders featuring excessive cell turnover, such as inflammatory bowel diseases.","10.1242/jcs.182584",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7026,"In vitro cyto-biocompatibility study of thin-film transistors substrates using an organotypic culture method.; NA; Thin-Film-Transistors Liquid-Crystal Display has become a standard in the field of displays. However, the structure of these devices presents interest not only in that field, but also for biomedical applications. One of the key components, called here TFT substrate, is a glass substrate with a dense and large array of thousands of transparent micro-electrodes that can be considered as a large scale multi-electrode array(s). Multi-electrode array(s) are widely used for in vitro electrical investigations on neurons and brain, allowing excitation, registration, and recording of their activity. However, the range of application of conventional multi-electrode array(s) is usually limited to some tens of cells in a homogeneous cell culture, because of a small area, small number and a low density of the micro-electrodes. TFT substrates do not have these limitations and the authors are currently studying the possibility to use TFT substrates as new tools for in vitro electrical investigation on tissues and organoids. In this respect, experiments to determine the cyto-biocompatibility of TFT substrates with tissues were conducted and are presented in this study. The investigation was performed using an organotypic culture method with explants of brain and liver tissues of chick embryos. The results in term of morphology, cell migration, cell density and adhesion were compared with the results from Thermanox(), a conventional plastic for cell culture, and with polydimethylsiloxane, a hydrophobic silicone. The results with TFT substrates showed similar results as for the Thermanox(), despite the TFT hydrophobicity. TFT substrates have a weak cell adhesion and promote cell migration similarly to Thermanox(). It could be concluded that the TFT substrates are cyto-biocompatible with the two studied organs.","10.1007/s10856-016-5815-1",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7028,"Microencapsulation of porcine thyroid cell organoids within a polymer microcapsule construct.; Microencapsulation and hormone deficiency and organoids and therapy and thyroid; Hypothyroidism is a common condition of hormone deficiency, and oral administration of thyroid hormones is currently the only available treatment option. However, there are some disadvantages with this treatment modality including compliance challenges to patients. Therefore, a physiologically based alternative therapy for hypothyroidism with little or no side-effects is needed. In this study, we have developed a method for microencapsulating porcine thyroid cells as a thyroid hormone replacement approach. The hybrid wall of the polymer microcapsules permits thyroid hormone release while preventing immunoglobulin antibodies from entry. This strategy could potentially enable implantation of the microcapsule organoids containing allogeneic or xenogeneic thyroid cells to secret hormones over time without the need for immunosuppression of recipients. Porcine thyroid cells were isolated and encapsulated in alginate-poly-L-ornithine-alginate microcapsules using a microfluidic device. The porcine thyroid cells formed three-dimensional follicular spheres in the microcapsules with decent cell viability and proliferation. Thyroxine release from the encapsulated cells was higher than from unencapsulated cells ( P<0.05) and was maintained during the entire duration of experiment (>28 days). These results suggest that the microencapsulated thyroid cell organoids may have the potential to be used for therapy and/or drug screening.","10.1177/1535370216673746",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

These advancements have been applied to mouse and human samples providing models for gastrointestinal tissue development and disease. We adapt these methods for the propagation of intestinal organoids (enteroids) from various large farm and small companion (LF/SC) animals, including cat, dog, cow, horse, pig, sheep and chicken. We show that LF/SC enteroids propagate and expand in L-WRN conditioned media containing signaling factors Wnt3a, R-spondin-3, and Noggin (WRN). Multiple successful isolations were achieved for each species, and the growth of LF/SC enteroids was maintained to high passage number. LF/SC enteroids expressed crypt stem cell marker LGR5 and low levels of mesenchymal marker VIM. Labeling with EdU also showed distinct regions of cell proliferation within the enteroids marking crypt-like regions. The ability to grow and maintain LF/SC enteroid cell lines provides additional models for the study of gastrointestinal developmental biology as well as platforms for the study of host-pathogen interactions between intestinal cells and zoonotic enteric pathogens of medical importance.","10.1242/bio.021717",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Steatosis also occurs in cats, where it can cause severe hepatic failure. Previous studies demonstrate the potential of liver organoids for modeling genetic diseases. To examine the possibility of using organoids to model steatosis, we established a long-term feline liver organoid culture with adult liver stem cell characteristics and differentiation potential toward hepatocyte-like cells. Next, organoids from mouse, human, dog, and cat liver were provided with fatty acids. Lipid accumulation was observed in all organoids and interestingly, feline liver organoids accumulated more lipid droplets than human organoids. Finally, we demonstrate effects of interference with -oxidation on lipid accumulation in feline liver organoids. In conclusion, feline liver organoids can be successfully cultured and display a predisposition for lipid accumulation, making them an interesting model in hepatic steatosis research.","10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.02.015",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7126,"Plasticity and aggregation of juvenile porcine islets in modified culture: Preliminary observations; Diabetes;  Islet culture;  Islet transplantation;  Porcine islets;  Xenotransplantation; Diabetes is a major health problem worldwide, and there is substantial interest in developing xenogeneic islet transplantation as a potential treatment. The potential to relieve the demand on an inadequate supply of human pancreata is dependent upon the efficiency of techniques for isolating and culturing islets from the source pancreata. Porcine islets are favored for xenotransplantation, but mature pigs (>2 years) present logistic and economic challenges, and young pigs (3-6 months) have not yet proven to be an adequate source. In this study, islets were isolated from 20 juvenile porcine pancreata (~3 months; 25 kg Yorkshire pigs) immediately following procurement or after 24 h of hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) preservation. The resulting islet preparations were characterized using a battery of tests during culture in silicone rubber membrane flasks. Islet biology assessment included oxygen consumption, insulin secretion, histopathology, and in vivo function. Islet yields were highest from HMP-preserved pancreata (2,242  449 IEQ/g). All preparations comprised a high proportion (>90%) of small islets (<100 m), and purity was on average 63  6%. Morphologically, islets appeared as clusters on day 0, loosely disaggregated structures at day 1, and transitioned to aggregated structures comprising both exocrine and endocrine cells by day 6. Histopathology confirmed both insulin and glucagon staining in cultures and grafts excised after transplantation in mice. Nuclear staining (Ki-67) confirmed mitotic activity consistent with the observed plasticity of these structures. Metabolic integrity was demonstrated by oxygen consumption rates = 175  16 nmol/min/mg DNA, and physiological function was intact by glucose stimulation after 6-8 days in culture. In vivo function was confirmed with blood glucose control achieved in nearly 50% (8/17) of transplants. Preparation and culture of juvenile porcine islets as a source for islet transplantation require specialized conditions. These immature islets undergo plasticity in culture and form fully functional multicellular structures. Further development of this method for culturing immature porcine islets is expected to generate small pancreatic tissue-derived organoids termed pancreatites, as a therapeutic product from juvenile pigs for xenotransplantation and diabetes research.  2016 Cognizant, LLC.","10.3727/096368916x691475",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7144,"Development of an Advanced Primary Human In Vitro Model of the Small Intestine.; NA; Intestinal in vitro models are valuable tools in drug discovery and infection research. Despite several advantages, the standard cell line-based Transwell() models based for example on colonic epithelial Caco-2 cells, lack the cellular complexity and transport activity associated with native small intestinal tissue. An additional experimental set-back arises from the most commonly used synthetic membranes, on which the cells are routinely cultured. These can lead to an additional barrier activity during in vitro testing. To overcome these limitations, we developed an alternative primary human small intestinal tissue model. This novel approach combines previously established gut organoid technology with a natural extracellular matrix (ECM) based on porcine small intestinal scaffold (SIS). Intestinal crypts from healthy human small intestine were expanded as gut organoids and seeded as single cells on SIS in a standardized Transwell-like setting. After only 7 days on the ECM scaffold, the primary cells formed an epithelial barrier while a subpopulation differentiated into intestinal specific cell types such as mucus-producing goblet cells or hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells. Furthermore, we tested the influence of subepithelial fibroblasts and dynamic culture conditions on epithelial barrier function. The barrier integrity was stabilized by coculture in the presence of gut-derived fibroblasts. Compared to static or dynamic culture on an orbital shaker, dynamic culture in a defined perfusion bioreactor had an additional significant impact on epithelial cell differentiation, indicated by high prismatic cell morphology and upregulation of CYP3A4 enzyme and Mdr1 transporter activity. In summary, more physiological tissue models as presented in our study might be useful tools in preclinical research and development.","10.1089/ten.tec.2016.0101",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

This expansion is thought to primarily reflect differences in proliferation versus differentiation of neural progenitors during cortical development. Here, we have searched for such differences by analysing cerebral organoids from human and chimpanzees using immunohistofluorescence, live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the cytoarchitecture, cell type composition, and neurogenic gene expression programs of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar. Notably, however, live imaging of apical progenitor mitosis uncovered a lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase in humans compared to chimpanzees that is specific to proliferating progenitors and not observed in non-neural cells. Consistent with this, the small set of genes more highly expressed in human apical progenitors points to increased proliferative capacity, and the proportion of neurogenic basal progenitors is lower in humans. These subtle differences in cortical progenitors between humans and chimpanzees may have consequences for human neocortex evolution.","10.7554/elife.18683",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7182,"Potential role of mitochondrial superoxide decreasing ferrochelatase and heme in coronary artery soluble guanylate cyclase depletion by angiotensin II.; guanosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate and protoporphyrin IX, nitric oxide and -aminolevulinic acid; Oxidation of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) heme promotes loss of regulation by nitric oxide (NO) and depletion of sGC. We hypothesized that angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulation of mitochondrial superoxide by its type 1 receptor could function as a potential inhibitor of heme biosynthesis by ferrochelatase, and this could decrease vascular responsiveness to NO by depleting sGC. These processes were investigated in a 24-h organoid culture model of bovine coronary arteries (BCA) with 0.1 M ANG II. Treatment of BCA with ANG II increased mitochondrial superoxide, depleted mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), ferrochelatase, and cytochrome oxidase subunit 4, and sGC, associated with impairment of relaxation to NO. These processes were attenuated by organoid culture with 8-bromo-cGMP and/or -aminolevulinic acid (a stimulator of sGC by protoporphyrin IX generation and heme biosynthesis). Organoid culture with Mito-TEMPOL, a scavenger of mitochondrial matrix superoxide, also attenuated ANG II-elicited ferrochelatase depletion and loss of relaxation to NO, whereas organoid culture with Tempol, an extramitochondrial scavenger of superoxide, attenuated the loss of relaxation to NO by ANG II, but not ferrochelatase depletion, suggesting cytosolic superoxide could be an initiating factor in the loss of sGC regulation by NO. The depletion of cytochrome oxidase subunit 4 and sGC (but not catalase) suggests that sGC expression may be very sensitive to depletion of heme caused by ANG II disrupting ferrochelatase activity by increasing mitochondrial superoxide. In addition, cGMP-dependent activation of protein kinase G appears to attenuate these ANG II-stimulated processes through both preventing SOD2 depletion and increases in mitochondrial and extramitochondrial superoxide.","10.1152/ajpheart.00859.2015",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Whereas techniques for the culture and genetic manipulation of ISCs from mice and humans are well established, similar methods for porcine stem cells have not been reported. Jejunal crypts were isolated from murine, human, and juvenile and adult porcine small intestine, suspended in Matrigel, and co-cultured with syngeneic intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) or cultured without feeder cells in various culture media. Media containing epidermal growth factor, noggin, and R-spondin 1 (ENR medium) were supplemented with various combinations of Wnt3a- or ISEMF-conditioned medium (CM) and with glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor (GSK3i), and their effects were studied on cultured crypts. Cell lineage differentiation was assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cultured porcine cells were serially passaged and transduced with a lentiviral vector. Whereas ENR medium supported murine enteroid growth, it did not sustain porcine crypts beyond 5 days. Supplementation of Wnt3a-CM and GSK3i resulted in the formation of complex porcine enteroids with budding extensions. These enteroids contained a mixture of stem and differentiated cells and were successfully passaged in the presence of GSK3i. Crypts grown in media supplemented with porcine ISEMF-CM formed spheroids that were less well differentiated than enteroids. Enteroids and spheroids were transfected with a lentivirus with high efficiency. Thus, our method maintains juvenile and adult porcine crypt cells long-term in culture.

7244,"Par6G suppresses cell proliferation and is targeted by loss-of-function mutations in multiple cancers.; NA; Differentiated epithelial structure communicates with individual constituent epithelial cells to suppress their proliferation activity. However, the pathways linking epithelial structure to cessation of the cell proliferation machinery or to unscheduled proliferation in the context of tumorigenesis are not well defined. Here we demonstrate the strong impact of compromised epithelial integrity on normal and oncogenic Myc-driven proliferation in three-dimensional mammary epithelial organoid culture. Systematic silencing of 34 human homologs of Drosophila genes, with previously established functions in control of epithelial integrity, demonstrates a role for human genes of apico-basal polarity, Wnt and Hippo pathways and actin dynamics in regulation of the size, integrity and cell proliferation in organoids. Perturbation of these pathways leads to diverse functional interactions with Myc: manifested as a RhoA-dependent synthetic lethality and Par6-dependent effects on the cell cycle. Furthermore, we show a role for Par6G as a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1/Akt pathway and epithelial cell proliferation and evidence for frequent inactivation of Par6G gene in epithelial cancers. The findings demonstrate that determinants of epithelial structure regulate the cell proliferation activity via conserved and cancer-relevant regulatory circuitries, which are important for epithelial cell cycle restriction and may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.","10.1038/onc.2015.196",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

One example of simple 3D culture is spheroids; ball shaped structures typically used as liver and tumour models. Oxygen is critically important in physiological processes, but is difficult to quantify in 3D culture: and the question arises, how small does a spheroid have to be to have minimal micro-environment formation? This question is of particular importance in the growing field of 3D based models for toxicological assessment. Here, we describe a simple non-invasive approach modified for the quantitative measurement and subsequent evaluation of oxygen gradients in spheroids developed from a non-malignant fish cell line (i.e. RTG-2 cells) using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) oximetry. Sonication of the paramagnetic probe Lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) allows for incorporation of probe particulates into spheroid during its formation. Spectra signal strength after incorporation of probe into spheroid indicated that a volume of 20 l of probe (stock solution: 0.10 mg/mL) is sufficient to provide a strong spectra across a range of spheroid sizes. The addition of non-toxic probes (that do not produce or consume oxygen) report on oxygen diffusion throughout the spheroid as a function of size. We provide evidence supporting the use of this model over a range of initial cell seeding densities and spheroid sizes with the production of oxygen distribution as a function of these parameters. In our spheroid model, lower cell seeding densities (2,500 cells/spheroid) and absolute size (11832 m) allow control of factors such as pre-existing stresses (e.g.  2% normoxic/hypoxic interface) for more accurate measurement of treatment response.

Age-associated mammary stem cell (MaSC) dysfunction is thought to play an important role in breast cancer carcinogenesis. Non-human primates with their close phylogenetic relationship to humans provide a powerful model system to study the effects of aging on human MaSC.

The treatment of mice with ALA attenuated pulmonary hypertension (assessed through echo Doppler flow of the pulmonary valve, and direct measurements of right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy), increases in pulmonary arterial superoxide (detected by lucigenin), and decreases in lung miR204 and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression. ALA treatment of BPA attenuated ET-1-induced increases in mitochondrial superoxide (detected by MitoSox), STAT3 phosphorylation, and decreases in miR204 and SOD2 expression. Because ALA increases BPA protoporphyrin IX (a stimulator of guanylate cyclase) and cGMP-mediated protein kinase G (PKG) activity, the effects of the PKG activator 8-bromo-cGMP were examined and found to also attenuate the ET-1-induced increase in superoxide. ET-1 increased superoxide production and the detection of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence, suggesting oxidant conditions might impair heme biosynthesis by ferrochelatase. However, chronic hypoxia actually increased ferrochelatase activity in mouse pulmonary arteries. Thus, a reversal of factors increasing mitochondrial superoxide and oxidant effects that potentially influence remodeling signaling related to miR204 expression and perhaps iron availability needed for the biosynthesis of heme by the ferrochelatase reaction could be factors in the beneficial actions of ALA in pulmonary hypertension.","10.1152/ajplung.00155.2014",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

CagA translocates into the cytoplasm where it stimulates cell signaling through the interaction with tyrosine kinase c-Met receptor, leading cellular proliferation. Identified as a potential gastric stem cell marker, cluster-of-differentiation (CD) CD44 also acts as a co-receptor for c-Met, but whether it plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial proliferation is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that CD44 plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation. To assay changes in gastric epithelial cell proliferation in relation to the direct interaction with H. pylori, human- and mouse-derived gastric organoids were infected with the G27 H. pylori strain or a mutant G27 strain bearing cagA deletion (CagA::cat). Epithelial proliferation was quantified by EdU immunostaining. Phosphorylation of c-Met was analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis for expression of CD44 and CagA. H. pylori infection of both mouse- and human-derived gastric organoids induced epithelial proliferation that correlated with c-Met phosphorylation. CagA and CD44 co-immunoprecipitated with phosphorylated c-Met. The formation of this complex did not occur in organoids infected with CagA::cat. Epithelial proliferation in response to H. pylori infection was lost in infected organoids derived from CD44-deficient mouse stomachs. Human-derived fundic gastric organoids exhibited an induction in proliferation when infected with H. pylori that was not seen in organoids pre-treated with a peptide inhibitor specific to CD44. In the well-established Mongolian gerbil model of gastric cancer, animals treated with CD44 peptide inhibitor Pep1, resulted in the inhibition of H. pylori-induced proliferation and associated atrophic gastritis. The current study reports a unique approach to study H. pylori interaction with the human gastric epithelium. Here, we show that CD44 plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation.","10.1371/journal.ppat.1004663",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7478,"Porcine liver decellularization under oscillating pressure conditions: A technical refinement to improve the homogeneity of the decellularization process; NA; Decellularization and recellularization of parenchymal organs may facilitate the generation of autologous functional liver organoids by repopulation of decellularized porcine liver matrices with induced liver cells. We present an accelerated (7 h overall perfusion time) and effective protocol for human-scale liver decellularization by pressure-controlled perfusion with 1% Triton X-100 and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate via the hepatic artery (120 mmHg) and portal vein (60 mmHg). In addition, we analyzed the effect of oscillating pressure conditions on pig liver decellularization (n=19). The proprietary perfusion device used to generate these pressure conditions mimics intra-abdominal conditions during respiration to optimize microperfusion within livers and thus optimize the homogeneity of the decellularization process. The efficiency of perfusion decellularization was analyzed by macroscopic observation, histological staining (hematoxylin and eosin [H&amp;E], Sirius red, and alcian blue), immunohistochemical staining (collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin), and biochemical assessment (DNA, collagen, and glycosaminoglycans) of decellularized liver matrices. The integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) postdecellularization was visualized by corrosion casting and three-dimensional computed tomography scanning. We found that livers perfused under oscillating pressure conditions (P+) showed a more homogenous course of decellularization and contained less DNA compared with livers perfused without oscillating pressure conditions (P-). Microscopically, livers from the (P-) group showed remnant cell clusters, while no cells were found in livers from the (P+) group. The grade of disruption of the ECM was higher in livers from the (P-) group, although the perfusion rates and pressure did not significantly differ. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that important matrix components were still present after decellularization. Corrosion casting showed an intact vascular (portal vein and hepatic artery) and biliary framework. In summary, the presented protocol for pig liver decellularization is quick (7 h) and effective. The application of oscillating pressure conditions improves the homogeneity of perfusion and thus the outcome of the decellularization process.

7493,"Small molecule and RNAi induced phenotype transition of expanded and primary colonic epithelial cells.; NA; Recent progress in mammalian intestinal epithelial cell culture led to novel concepts of tissue modeling. Especially the development of phenotypically stable cell lines from individual animals enables an investigation of distinct intestinal loci and disease states. We here report primary and prolonged culture of normal porcine epithelial cells from colon for cell line development. In addition, a novel primary three-dimensional intestinal culture system is presented, which generated organoids composed of a highly polarized epithelial layer lining a core of subepithelial tissue. Cellular characterization of monolayer cell lines revealed epithelial identity and pointed to a proliferative crypt cell phenotype. We evaluated both RNAi and chemical approaches to induce epithelial differentiation in generated cell lines by targeting promoters of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). By in silico prediction and ectopic expression, miR-147b was proven to be a potent trigger of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. Our results outline an approach to generate phenotypically stable cell lines expanded from primary colonic epithelial cultures and demonstrate the relevance of miR-147b and chemical inhibitors for promoting epithelial differentiation features.","10.1038/srep12681",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7596,"Luminal signalling links cell communication to tissue architecture during organogenesis.; NA; Morphogenesis is the process whereby cell collectives are shaped into differentiated tissues and organs. The self-organizing nature of morphogenesis has been recently demonstrated by studies showing that stem cells in three-dimensional culture can generate complex organoids, such as mini-guts, optic-cups and even mini-brains. To achieve this, cell collectives must regulate the activity of secreted signalling molecules that control cell differentiation, presumably through the self-assembly of microenvironments or niches. However, mechanisms that allow changes in tissue architecture to feedback directly on the activity of extracellular signals have not been described. Here we investigate how the process of tissue assembly controls signalling activity during organogenesis in vivo, using the migrating zebrafish lateral line primordium. We show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activity within the tissue controls the frequency at which it deposits rosette-like mechanosensory organs. Live imaging reveals that FGF becomes specifically concentrated in microluminal structures that assemble at the centre of these organs and spatially constrain its signalling activity. Genetic inhibition of microlumen assembly and laser micropuncture experiments demonstrate that microlumina increase signalling responses in participating cells, thus allowing FGF to coordinate the migratory behaviour of cell groups at the tissue rear. As the formation of a central lumen is a self-organizing property of many cell types, such as epithelia and embryonic stem cells, luminal signalling provides a potentially general mechanism to locally restrict, coordinate and enhance cell communication within tissues.","10.1038/nature13852",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
7646,"A new, straightforward ex vivo organoid bladder mucosal model for preclinical research; mucous membrane;  organoids;  swine;  tissue scaffolds;  urinary bladder; Purpose: We developed an experimental ex vivo organoid bladder mucosal model that can be used for experimental research purposes to create alternatives to current animal models. Materials and Methods: We developed an ex vivo organoid bladder mucosal model by immobilizing a type I collagen scaffold on the bottom of a Transwell insert, creating a 2-compartment system. Mucosal biopsies from porcine bladders were placed on top of the scaffold and cultured in different mediums. We evaluated the morphological aspects of biopsy tissue. Cultured samples were assessed by scanning electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for cell identification, proliferation and morphology. Results: Cells remained viable in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and smooth muscle cell medium for up to 3 weeks. The mucosa retained normal morphological characteristics for up to 1 week. Cells (mostly urothelial cells) proliferated and fully covered the scaffold surface within 3 weeks. Conclusions: We developed an experimental ex vivo organoid model of bladder mucosa for preclinical experimental research. This model could be used for high volume screening for pharmacology and toxicology experiments.

We previously reported full-thickness intestine formation using an organoid units-on-scaffold approach in rodent and swine models. Transplanted intestinal xenografts have been documented to survive from human fetal tissue but not from postnatal tissue. We now present the first report of human TESI from postnatal tissue. Methods: Organoid units (OU) were prepared from human small bowel resection specimens, loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into NOD/SCID gamma chain-deficient mice. After 4 weeks, TESI was harvested and immunostained for 2-microglobulin to identify human tissue, villin for enterocytes, lysozyme for Paneth cells, chromogranin-A for enteroendocrine cells, mucin-2 for goblet cells, smooth muscle actin and desmin to demonstrate muscularis, and S-100 for nerves. Results: All TESI was of human origin. Immunofluorescence staining of human TESI reveals the presence of all four differentiated cell types of mature human small intestine, in addition to the muscularis and the supporting intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts.

7660,"Retromer dependent recycling of the Wnt secretion factor Wls is dispensable for stem cell maintenance in the mammalian intestinal epithelium.; NA; In C. elegans and Drosophila, retromer mediated retrograde transport of Wntless (Wls) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is required for Wnt secretion. When this retrograde transport pathway is blocked, Wls is missorted to lysosomes and degraded, resulting in reduced Wnt secretion and various Wnt related phenotypes. In the mammalian intestine, Wnt signaling is essential to maintain stem cells. This prompted us to ask if retromer mediated Wls recycling is also important for Wnt signaling and stem cell maintenance in this system. To answer this question, we generated a conditional Vps35 (fl) allele. As Vps35 is an essential subunit of the retromer complex, this genetic tool allowed us to inducibly interfere with retromer function in the intestinal epithelium. Using a pan-intestinal epithelial Cre line (Villin-CreERT2), we did not observe defects in crypt or villus morphology after deletion of Vps35 from the intestinal epithelium. Wnt secreted from the mesenchyme of the intestine may compensate for a reduction in epithelial Wnt secretion. To exclude the effect of the mesenchyme, we generated intestinal organoid cultures. Loss of Vps35 in intestinal organoids did not affect the overall morphology of the organoids. We were able to culture Vps35 (/) organoids for many passages without Wnt supplementation in the growth medium. However, Wls protein levels were reduced and we observed a subtle growth defect in the Vps35 (/) organoids. These results confirm the role of retromer in the retrograde trafficking of Wls in the intestine, but show that retromer mediated Wls recycling is not essential to maintain Wnt signaling or stem cell proliferation in the intestinal epithelium.","10.1371/journal.pone.0076971",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7671,"Nestin-expressing cells in the gut give rise to enteric neurons and glial cells; Enteric nervous system;  Hirschsprung's disease;  Nestin;  Neural stem cell;  Neurosphere; Background Neuronal stem cells (NSCs) are promising for neurointestinal disease therapy. Although NSCs have been isolated from intestinal musclularis, their presence in mucosa has not been well described. Mucosa-derived NSCs are accessible endoscopically and could be used autologously. Brain-derived Nestin-positive NSCs are important in endogenous repair and plasticity. The aim was to isolate and characterize mucosa-derived NSCs, determine their relationship to Nestin-expressing cells and to demonstrate their capacity to produce neuroglial networks in vitro and in vivo. Methods Neurospheres were generated from periventricular brain, colonic muscularis (Musc), and mucosa-submucosa (MSM) of mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) controlled by the Nestin promoter (Nestin-GFP). Neuronal stem cells were also grown as adherent colonies from intestinal mucosal organoids. Their differentiation potential was assessed using immunohistochemistry using glial and neuronal markers. Brain and gut-derived neurospheres were transplanted into explants of chick embryonic aneural hindgut to determine their fate. Key Results Musc- and MSM-derived neurospheres expressed Nestin and gave rise to cells of neuronal, glial, and mesenchymal lineage. Although Nestin expression in tissue was mostly limited to glia co-labelled with glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), neurosphere-derived neurons and glia both expressed Nestin in vitro, suggesting that Nestin+/GFAP+ glial cells may give rise to new neurons. Moreover, following transplantation into aneural colon, brain- and gut-derived NSCs were able to differentiate into neurons. Conclusions & Inferences Nestin-expressing intestinal NSCs cells give rise to neurospheres, differentiate into neuronal, glial, and mesenchymal lineages in vitro, generate neurons in vivo and can be isolated from mucosa.

Recently developed protocols for growing organoids containing crypts and villus from adult mouse intestinal epithelium in Matrigel present an attractive alternative to the classical techniques. However, these approaches require the use of sophisticated and expensive serum-free medium supplemented with epithelial growth factor (EGF), Wnt agonist (R-spondin 1), and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (Noggin) in high concentrations. Here we demonstrate that is possible to use an isolated chicken embryonic intestinal epithelium to create such an organoid culture. Structures formed in Matrigel matrix in the first two days following isolation survive and enlarge during ensuing weeks. They have the appearance of empty spheres and comprise cells expressing cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker), villin (a marker of enterocytes), and Sox-9 (a transcription factor characteristic of progenitors and stem cells of intestinal crypts). With chicken embryonic tissue as a source of organoids, prostaglandin E2 is as effective as R-spondin 1 and Noggin in promoting sustained growth and survival of epithelial spheroids.","10.2144/0000113851",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"
7732,"Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition reverts prostate fibroblast-to- myofibroblast Trans-differentiation; NA; Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Because BPH is primarily driven by fibroblast-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of the PDE5 inhibitor vardenafil to inhibit and reverse trans-differentation of primary human prostatic stromal cells (PrSC). Vardenafil, sodium nitroprusside, lentiviral-delivered short hairpin RNA-mediated PDE5 knockdown, sodium orthovanadate, and inhibitors of MAPK kinase, protein kinase G, Ras homolog family member (Rho) A, RhoA/Rho kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and protein kinase B (AKT) were applied to PrSC treated with basic fibroblast growth factor (fibroblasts) or TGFbeta1 (myofibroblasts) in vitro, in chicken chorioallantoic membrane xenografts in vivo, and to prostatic organoids ex vivo. Fibroblast-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation was monitored by smooth muscle cell actin and IGF binding protein 3 mRNA and protein levels. Vardenafil significantly attenuated TGFbeta1-induced PrSC trans-differentiation in vitro and in chorioallantoic membrane xenografts. Enhancement of nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling by vardenafil, sodium nitroprusside, or PDE5 knockdown reduced smooth muscle cell actin and IGF binding protein 3mRNA and protein levels and restored fibroblast-like morphology in trans-differentiated myofibroblast. This reversal of trans-differentiation was not affected by MAPK kinase, protein kinase G, RhoA, or RhoA/Rho kinase inhibition, but vardenafil attenuated phospho-AKT levels in myofibroblasts. Consistently, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase or AKT inhibition induced reversal of trans-differentiation, whereas the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate abrogated the effect of vardenafil. Treatment of prostatic organoids with vardenafil ex vivo reduced expression of myofibroblast markers, indicating reverse remodeling of stroma towards a desired higher fibroblast/myofibroblast ratio. Thus, enhancement of the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling pathway by vardenafil attenuates and reverts fibroblast-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation, hypothesizing that BPH patients might benefit from long-term therapy with PDE5 inhibitors.

7772,"Roles for redox mechanisms controlling protein kinase G in pulmonary and coronary artery responses to hypoxia.; NA; We previously reported that isolated endothelium-removed bovine pulmonary arteries (BPAs) contract to hypoxia associated with removal of peroxide- and cGMP-mediated relaxation. In contrast, bovine coronary arteries (BCAs) relax to hypoxia associated with cytosolic NADPH oxidation coordinating multiple relaxing mechanisms. Since we recently found that H(2)O(2) relaxes BPAs through PKG activation by both soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)/cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent thiol oxidation/subunit dimerization mechanisms, we investigated if these mechanisms participate in BPA contraction and BCA relaxation to hypoxia. The contraction of BPA (precontracted with 20 mM KCl) to hypoxia was associated with decreased PKG dimerization and PKG-mediated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation. In contrast, exposure of 20 mM KCl-precontracted endothelium-removed BCAs to hypoxia caused relaxation and increased dimerization and VASP phosphorylation. Depletion of sGC by organoid culture of BPAs with an oxidant of the sGC heme (10 M 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) increased aerobic force generation, decreased VASP phosphorylation, and inhibited further contraction to hypoxia and changes in VASP phosphorylation. Thiol reduction with dithiothreitol increased aerobic force in BPAs and decreased PKG dimerization, VASP phosphorylation, and the contraction to hypoxia. Furthermore, PKG-1 and sGC (1)-subunit small interfering RNA-transfected BPAs demonstrated increased aerobic K(+) force and inhibition of further contraction to hypoxia, associated with an attenuation of H(2)O(2)-elicited relaxation and VASP phosphorylation. Thus, decreases in both a sGC/cGMP-dependent and a dimerization-dependent activation of PKG by H(2)O(2) appear to contribute to the contraction of BPAs elicited by hypoxia. In addition, stimulation of PKG activation by dimerization may be important in the relaxation of coronary arteries to hypoxia.","10.1152/ajpheart.00624.2011",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

To date, the methods used to successfully create tooth organoids capable of forming functional teeth have been quite limited. Recently, hydrogel microparticles (HMP) have demonstrated utility in tissue repair and regeneration based on their useful characteristics, including their scaffolding ability, effective cell and drug delivery, their ability to mimic the natural tissue extracellular matrix, and their injectability. These outstanding properties led us to investigate the utility of using HMPs (average diameter: 158  32 m) derived from methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) (degree of substitution: 100%) to create tooth organoids. The tooth organoids were created by seeding human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) and porcine dental epithelial cells (pDE) onto the HMPs, which provided an extensive surface area for the cells to effectively attach and proliferate. Interestingly, the cell-seeded HMPs cultured on low-attachment tissue culture plates with gentle rocking self-assembled into organoids, within which the cells maintained their viability and morphology throughout the incubation period. The self-assembled organoids reached a volume of ~50 mm(3) within two weeks of the in vitro tissue culture. The co-cultured hDPSC-HMP and pDE-HMP structures effectively attached to each other without any externally applied forces. The presence of polarized, differentiated dental cells in these composite tooth-bud organoids demonstrated the potential of self-assembled dental cell HMPs to form tooth-bud organoid-like structures for potential applications in tooth regeneration strategies.","10.3390/bioengineering9050215",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

10081,"Rotavirus C Replication in Porcine Intestinal Enteroids Reveals Roles for Cellular Cholesterol and Sialic Acids.; cholesterol and histo-blood-group antigens and porcine intestinal enteroids and rotavirus C and sialic acids; Rotaviruses (RVs) are a significant cause of severe diarrheal illness in infants and young animals, including pigs. Group C rotavirus (RVC) is an emerging pathogen increasingly reported in pigs and humans worldwide, and is currently recognized as the major cause of gastroenteritis in neonatal piglets that results in substantial economic losses to the pork industry. However, little is known about RVC pathogenesis due to the lack of a robust cell culture system, with the exception of the RVC Cowden strain. Here, we evaluated the permissiveness of porcine crypt-derived 3D and 2D intestinal enteroid (PIE) culture systems for RVC infection. Differentiated 3D and 2D PIEs were infected with porcine RVC (PRVC) Cowden G1P[1], PRVC104 G3P[18], and PRVC143 G6P[5] virulent strains, and the virus replication was measured by qRT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that all RVC strains replicated in 2D-PIEs poorly, while 3D-PIEs supported a higher level of replication, suggesting that RVC selectively infects terminally differentiated enterocytes, which were less abundant in the 2D vs. 3D PIE cultures. While cellular receptors for RVC are unknown, target cell surface carbohydrates, including histo-blood-group antigens (HBGAs) and sialic acids (SAs), are believed to play a role in cell attachment/entry. The evaluation of the selective binding of RVCs to different HBGAs revealed that PRVC Cowden G1P[1] replicated to the highest titers in the HBGA-A PIEs, while PRVC104 or PRVC143 achieved the highest titers in the HBGA-H PIEs. Further, contrasting outcomes were observed following sialidase treatment (resulting in terminal SA removal), which significantly enhanced Cowden and RVC143 replication, but inhibited the growth of PRVC104. These observations suggest that different RVC strains may recognize terminal (PRVC104) as well as internal (Cowden and RVC143) SAs on gangliosides. Finally, several cell culture additives, such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran, cholesterol, and bile extract, were tested to establish if they could enhance RVC replication. We observed that only DEAE-dextran significantly enhanced RVC attachment, but it had no effect on RVC replication. Additionally, the depletion of cellular cholesterol by MCD inhibited Cowden replication, while the restoration of the cellular cholesterol partially reversed the MCD effects. These results suggest that cellular cholesterol plays an important role in the replication of the PRVC strain tested. Overall, our study has established a novel robust and physiologically relevant system to investigate RVC pathogenesis. We also generated novel, experimentally derived evidence regarding the role of host glycans, DEAE, and cholesterol in RVC replication, which is critical for the development of control strategies.","10.3390/v14081825",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

10178,"High-efficient engineering of osteo-callus organoids for rapid bone regeneration within one month.; 3D cell culture system and Bioprinting and Bone regeneration and Endochondral ossification and Organoids; Large bone defects that cannot form a callus tissue are often faced with long-time recovery. Developmental engineering-based strategies with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) aggregates have shown enhanced potential for bone regeneration. However, MSC aggregates are different from the physiological callus tissues, which limited the further endogenous osteogenesis. This study aims to achieve engineering of osteo-callus organoids for rapid bone regeneration in cooperation with bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC)-loaded hydrogel microspheres (MSs) by digital light-processing (DLP) printing technology and stepwise-induction. The printed MSC-loaded MSs aggregated into osteo-callus organoids after chondrogenic induction and showed much higher chondrogenic efficiency than that of traditional MSC pellets. Moreover, the osteo-callus organoids exhibited stage-specific gene expression pattern that recapitulated endochondral ossification process, as well as a synchronized state of cell proliferation and differentiation, which highly resembled the diverse cell compositions and behaviors of developmentally endochondral ossification. Lastly, the osteo-callus organoids efficiently led to rapid bone regeneration within only 4 weeks in a large bone defect in rabbits which need 2-3 months in previous tissue engineering studies. The findings suggested that in vitro engineering of osteo-callus organoids with developmentally osteogenic properties is a promising strategy for rapid bone defect regeneration and recovery.","10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121741",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Not only is it a great system in and of itself, but these qualities make it a great host for interspecies chimera experiments. In this chapter we highlight some notable examples of mammalian-chick chimeras, and show how one can for instance use the chick to push mammalian stem cell experiments further to learn about the behavior and capabilities of these cells in vivo. In particular, here we present the methodology necessary for transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived ""gastruloids"" stimulated to generate a human organizer into the chick embryo. In these human-chick chimeras, the human organizer cells self-organize to contribute directly to notochord-like tissue and indirectly induce host chick cells to generate neural tissue.","10.1007/978-1-4939-9524-0_6",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
10214,"Time-restricted feeding downregulates cholesterol biosynthesis program via ROR-mediated chromatin modification in porcine liver organoids.; Cholesterol biosynthesis program and Histone modification and Pig and Porcine liver organoids and ROR and Time-restricted feeding; BACKGROUND: Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a dieting strategy based on nutrients availability and diurnal rhythm, shown to improve lipid metabolism efficiency. We have demonstrated previously that retinoic acid-related (RAR) orphan receptor (ROR)  is the primary transcription factor controlling cholesterol (CHO) biosynthesis program of animals. However, the functional role of ROR in liver physiology of pigs in response to TRF has not been determined, largely due to the lack of functional models and molecular tools. In the present study, we established porcine liver organoids and subjected them to restricted nutrients supply for 10-h during the light portion of the day. RESULTS: Our results showed that TRF regimen did not alter hepatocyte physiology, including unchanged cell viability, caspase 3/7 enzyme activity and the gene signature of cell proliferation in porcine liver organoids, compared to the control group (P >0.05). Furthermore, we found that TRF downregulated the hepatic CHO biosynthesis program at both mRNA and protein levels, along with the reduced cellular CHO content in porcine liver organoids (P<0.05). Using unbiased bioinformatic analysis of a previous ChIP-seq data and ChIP-qPCR validation, we revealed ROR as the predominant transcription factor that responded to TRF, amongst the 12 targeted nuclear receptors (NRs) (P<0.05). This was likely through ROR direct binding to the MVK gene (encoding mevalonate kinase). Finally, we showed that ROR agonists and overexpression enhanced the enrichment of co-factor p300, histone marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1/2, as well as RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) at the locus of MVK, in TRF-porcine liver organoids, compared to TRF-vector control (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that TRF triggers the ROR-mediated chromatin remodeling at the locus of CHO biosynthesis genes in porcine liver organoids and further improves lipid metabolism.","10.1186/s40104-020-00511-9",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

10330,"Human Norovirus NTPase Antagonizes Interferon- Production by Interacting With IkB Kinase .; IkB kinase and NTPase and human norovirus and interferon-regulatory factor-3 and interferon-; Human norovirus (HuNoV) is the leading cause of epidemic acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Type I interferons (IFN)-/ are highly potent cytokines that are initially identified for their essential roles in antiviral defense. It was reported that HuNoV infection did not induce IFN- expression but was controlled in the presence of IFN- in human intestinal enteroids and a gnotobiotic pig model, suggesting that HuNoV has likely developed evasion countermeasures. In this study, we found that a cDNA clone of GII.4 HuNoV, the predominantly circulating genotype worldwide, inhibits the production of IFN- and identified the viral NTPase as a key component responsible for such inhibition. HuNoV NTPase not only inhibits the activity of IFN- promoter but also the mRNA and protein production of IFN-. Additional studies indicate that NTPase inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), leading to the suppression of IFN- promoter activation. Mechanistically, NTPase interacts with IkB kinase  (IKK), an important factor for IRF-3 phosphorylation, and such interaction blocks the association of IKK with unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, resulting in the inhibition of IKK phosphorylation. Further studies demonstrated that the 1-179 aa domain of NTPase which interacts with IKK is critical for the suppression of IFN- production. Our findings highlight the role of HuNoV NTPase in the inhibition of IFN- production, providing insights into a novel mechanism underlying how HuNoV evades the host innate immunity.","10.3389/fmicb.2021.687933",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
10343,"Production, Characterization, and Function of Pseudoislets from Perinatal Canine Pancreas; diabetes;  dog models;  islet transplantation;  pseudoislets;   cells; We evaluated the cell composition and function of canine pancreatic pseudoislets (PIs) produced from 42- to 55-day-old fetuses, 1- to 21-day-old pups, and an adult dog pancreas. After mild collagenase treatment, partially digested tissues were cultured for 2-3 weeks. PI production started on culture day 3, was marked for 6 to 9 days, and then stopped. PI production was greatest with the neonatal specimens, reaching about 12 million aggregates per litter (55-day-old fetus) or per pancreas (1-day-old pup). Cell composition at all stages was similar to that in adult pancreatic islets, with predominant  cells, scant  cells and, most importantly, presence of  cells. Among pancreatic markers assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) mRNA assay, insulin showed the highest expression levels in PIs from newborn and adult pancreas, although these were more than 1000 times lower than in adult islets. Pdx1 mRNA expression was high in PIs from 55-day-old pancreases and was lower at later stages. Consistent with the qRT-PCR results, the insulin content was far lower than reported in adult dog pancreatic islets. However, insulin release by PIs from 1-day-old pups was demonstrated and was stimulated by a high-glucose medium. PIs were transplanted into euglycemic and diabetic SCID mice. In euglycemic animals, the transplant cell composition underwent maturation and transplants were still viable after 6 months. In diabetic mice, the PI transplants produced insulin and partially controlled the hyperglycemia. These data indicate that PIs can be produced ex vivo from canine fetal or postnatal pancreases. Although functional PIs can be obtained, the production yield is most likely insufficient to meet the requirements for diabetic dog transplantation without further innovation in cell culture amplification.

However, the biocompatibility of those additives is not well known. The objective of the study was to characterize the impact of zinc stearate-a common additive- through the development of a novel three-dimensional (3-D) in vitro platform with endometrial cells from domestic cats. Epithelial and stromal cells from adult uteri were isolated and cultured in medium supplemented with 3% Matrigel for two weeks in plastic tissue culture dishes that had been identified as polystyrene with and without zinc stearate by Raman, FTIR, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopies. Three-dimensional cell structures that were obtained were measured and categorized by shape. Cell viability, proliferation, differentiation, organization, and apoptosis then were assessed by immuno-staining. Results indicated that zinc stearate did not affect 3-D endometrial cell structure morphology, viability, or cellular composition.

Notably, while these xenografts were rejected in dogs that were not immunosuppressed, transplants in most dogs receiving systemic immunosuppression survived up to 3-5 months postinjection. Moreover, differentiation of donor PRPCs into photoreceptors with synaptic pedicle-like structures that established contact with second-order neurons was enhanced in rcd1/PDE6B mutant dogs.

The ability to xenograft tumors in either subcutaneous or orthotopic locations provides a robust model to study diverse biological features of human malignancies. However, there is a dire need for large animal models that better recapitulate human anatomy in terms of size and physiology.

10591,"Development of a Cytocompatible Scaffold from Pig Immature Testicular Tissue Allowing Human Sertoli Cell Attachment, Proliferation and Functionality.; decellularization and decellularized tissue and extracellular matrix and fertility preservation and immature testicular tissue and regenerative medicine and scaffold and testicular organoid and tissue engineering; Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue before chemo/radiotherapy is the only option to preserve fertility of cancer-affected prepubertal boys. To avoid reintroduction of malignant cells, development of a transplantable scaffold by decellularization of pig immature testicular tissue (ITT) able to support decontaminated testicular cells could be an option for fertility restoration in these patients. We, therefore, compared decellularization protocols to produce a cytocompatible scaffold. Fragments of ITT from 15 piglets were decellularized using three protocols: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-Triton (ST), Triton-SDS-Triton (TST) and trypsin 0.05%/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 0.02%-Triton (TET) with varying detergent concentrations. All protocols were able to lower DNA levels. Collagen retention was demonstrated in all groups except ST 1%, and a significant decrease in glycosaminoglycans was observed in the TST 1% and TET 1% groups. When Sertoli cells (SCs) were cultured with decellularized tissue, no signs of cytotoxicity were detected. A higher SC proliferation rate and greater stem cell factor secretion were observed than with SCs cultured without scaffold. ST 0.01% and TET 3% conditions offered the best compromise in terms of DNA elimination and extracellular matrix (ECM) preservation, while ensuring good attachment, proliferation and functionality of human SCs.

The mouse is the most commonly used vertebrate model for the analysis of gene function because of the well-established genetic tools that are available for loss-of-function studies. However, studies of gene function during development can be problematic in mammals. Many genes are active during different stages of development. Absence of gene function during early development may cause aberrant neurogenesis or even embryonic lethality and thus prevent analysis of later stages of development. To avoid these problems, precise temporal control of gene silencing is required.In contrast to mammals, oviparous animals are accessible for experimental manipulations during embryonic development. The combination of accessibility and RNAi- or Crispr/Cas9-based gene silencing makes the chicken embryo a powerful model for developmental studies. Depending on the time window during which gene silencing is attempted, chicken embryos can be used in ovo or ex ovo in a domed dish for easier access during later stages of development.

10613,"Inflammatory cytokines directly disrupt the bovine intestinal epithelial barrier.; NA; The small intestinal mucosa constitutes a physical barrier separating the gut lumen from sterile internal tissues. Junctional complexes between cells regulate transport across the barrier, preventing water loss and the entry of noxious molecules or pathogens. Inflammatory diseases in cattle disrupt this barrier; nonetheless, mechanisms of barrier disruption in cattle are poorly understood. We investigated the direct effects of three inflammatory cytokines, TNF, IFN, and IL-18, on the bovine intestinal barrier utilizing intestinal organoids. Flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran was used to investigate barrier permeability. Immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate junctional morphology, specifically tortuosity and length/width, respectively. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry was used to investigate cellular turnover via proliferation and apoptosis. Our study shows that 24-h cytokine treatment with TNF or IFN significantly increased dextran permeability and tight junctional tortuosity, and reduced cellular proliferation. TNF reduced the percentage of G2/M phase cells, and IFN treatment increased cell apoptotic rate. IL-18 did not directly induce significant changes to barrier permeability or cellular turnover.

This is of utmost importance for cardiac tissue engineering, since cardiomyocytes are extremely sensitive to malnutrition and hypoxia in vitro and after implantation. To develop a perfusable myocardial patch, we have focused on seeding a decellularized biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM) with endothelial cells. BioVaM is produced by decellularization of porcine small intestinal segments with preserved arterial and venous pedicles, which can be connected to a perfusion system in vitro or the host vasculature in vivo. The BioVaM vessel bed was re-seeded with porcine primary endothelial cells (pCEC). Seeding efficiency was influenced by detergent composition used for decellularization (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and/or Triton X-100) and the medium composition used for re-seeding. After decellularization, residual SDS was detected in the matrix affecting the survival of pCEC which showed a low tolerance to SDS and Triton X-100. Sensitivity to detergents was attenuated by supplementation of the medium with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or fetal calf serum (FCS). Pre-conditioning of the BioVaM with 20 % FCS was not sufficient to attain pCEC survival in the vascular bed. However, re-cellularization was achieved by prolonged FCS supplementation during cultivation, resulting in a perfusable, re-endothelialized matrix of 11 cm2 in size. This achievement represents a promising step towards engineering of perfusable, 3D cardiac constructs with clinically relevant dimensions.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00395-014-0441-x",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
10643,"Together is Better: mRNA Co-Encapsulation in Lipoplexes is Required to Obtain Ratiometric Co-Delivery and Protein Expression on the Single Cell Level.; cellular uptake and mingle/single-mRNA lipoplex and protein expression and single cell and theoretical modeling; Liposomes can efficiently deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) into cells. When mRNA cocktails encoding different proteins are needed, a considerable challenge is to efficiently deliver all mRNAs into the cytosol of each individual cell. In this work, two methods are explored to co-deliver varying ratiometric doses of mRNA encoding red (R) or green (G) fluorescent proteins and it is found that packaging mRNAs into the same lipoplexes (mingle-lipoplexes) is crucial to efficiently deliver multiple mRNA types into the cytosol of individual cells according to the pre-defined ratio. A mixture of lipoplexes containing only one mRNA type (single-lipoplexes), however, seem to follow the ""first come - first serve"" principle, resulting in a large variation of R/G uptake and expression levels for individual cells leading to ratiometric dosing only on the population level, but rarely on the single-cell level. These experimental observations are quantitatively explained by a theoretical framework based on the stochasticity of mRNA uptake in cells and endosomal escape of mingle- and single-lipoplexes, respectively. Furthermore, the findings are confirmed in 3D retinal organoids and zebrafish embryos, where mingle-lipoplexes outperformed single-lipoplexes to reliably bring both mRNA types into single cells. This benefits applications that require a strict control of protein expression in individual cells.","10.1002/advs.202102072",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
10698,"A deep learning approach for staging embryonic tissue isolates with small data.; NA; Machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly widespread and are now present in most areas of research. Their recent surge can be explained in part due to our ability to generate and store enormous amounts of data with which to train these models. The requirement for large training sets is also responsible for limiting further potential applications of machine learning, particularly in fields where data tend to be scarce such as developmental biology. However, recent research seems to indicate that machine learning and Big Data can sometimes be decoupled to train models with modest amounts of data. In this work we set out to train a CNN-based classifier to stage zebrafish tail buds at four different stages of development using small information-rich data sets. Our results show that two and three dimensional convolutional neural networks can be trained to stage developing zebrafish tail buds based on both morphological and gene expression confocal microscopy images, achieving in each case up to 100% test accuracy scores. Importantly, we show that high accuracy can be achieved with data set sizes of under 100 images, much smaller than the typical training set size for a convolutional neural net. Furthermore, our classifier shows that it is possible to stage isolated embryonic structures without the need to refer to classic developmental landmarks in the whole embryo, which will be particularly useful to stage 3D culture in vitro systems such as organoids. We hope that this work will provide a proof of principle that will help dispel the myth that large data set sizes are always required to train CNNs, and encourage researchers in fields where data are scarce to also apply ML approaches.","10.1371/journal.pone.0244151",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
10702,"Lipid desaturation-associated endoplasmic reticulum stress regulates MYCN gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells; NA; Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide due to its high rate of recurrence, in part because of cancer stem cell (CSC)-dependent field cancerization. Recently, we identified that the oncogene v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog (MYCN) marked CSC-like subpopulations in heterogeneous HCC and served as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker for HCC. In this study, we explored the molecular basis of upregulated MYCN gene expression in HCC cells. Liquid chromatograph time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolome analysis demonstrated that the content of unsaturated fatty acids was increased in MYCN high expression (MYCNhigh) CSC-like HCC cells. Inhibition of lipid desaturation using either the chemical inhibitor or siRNA/shRNA against stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) suppressed cell proliferation as well as MYCN gene expression in MYCNhigh HCC cells, grown as both monolayer and spheres. Further mechanistic study using RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related signaling networks such as endocannabinoid cancer inhibition pathway were under the control of SCD1 in MYCNhigh HCC cells. Furthermore, the expression of ER stress-inducible transcription suppressor cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF3) was downregulated in MYCNhigh CSC-like HCC cells and CSC-rich spheroids, which was upregulated by inhibition of lipid desaturation or treatment with acyclic retinoid (ACR). Lipid profiling using NMR spectroscopy revealed that the ACR dramatically reduced the content of unsaturated fatty acids in HCC cells. The chemical inducer of ER stress inhibited MYCN gene expression, while the chemical inhibitor of ER stress or knockdown of ATF3 gene expression partially rescued the suppression of MYCN gene expression by ACR in MYCNhigh HCC cells.

Primary bovine mammary epithelial cells segregated in four different populations according to the expression of P-Cadherin and CD49f. Sorted cells from each fraction were tested for the presence of lineage-restricted progenitors and stem cells. Only cells from the CD49f(high)/P-Cadherin(neg) subpopulation were able to give rise to both luminal- and myoepithelial-restricted colonies in vitro and generate organized outgrowths in vivo, which are hallmarks of stem cell activity. After whole transcriptome analysis, we found gene clusters to be differentially enriched that relate to cell-to-cell communication, metabolic processes, proliferation, migration and morphogenesis. When we analyzed only the genes that were differentially expressed in the stem cell enriched fraction, clusters of downregulated genes were related to proliferation, while among the upregulated expression, cluster of genes related to cell adhesion, migration and cytoskeleton organization were observed. Our results show that P-Cadherin separates mammary subpopulations differentially in progenitor cells or mammary stem cells. Further we provide a comprehensive observation of the gene expression differences among these cell populations which reinforces the assumption that bovine mammary stem cells are typically quiescent.","10.1038/s41598-020-71179-4",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
10777,"The E3 ubiquitin ligase component, Cereblon, is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of Wnt signaling.; NA; Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are important for the treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome. Binding of IMiDs to Cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor of the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase, induces cancer cell death by targeting key neo-substrates for degradation. Despite this clinical significance, the physiological regulation of CRBN remains largely unknown. Herein we demonstrate that Wnt, the extracellular ligand of an essential signal transduction pathway, promotes the CRBN-dependent degradation of a subset of proteins. These substrates include Casein kinase 1 (CK1), a negative regulator of Wnt signaling that functions as a key component of the -Catenin destruction complex. Wnt stimulation induces the interaction of CRBN with CK1 and its resultant ubiquitination, and in contrast with previous reports does so in the absence of an IMiD. Mechanistically, the destruction complex is critical in maintaining CK1 stability in the absence of Wnt, and in recruiting CRBN to target CK1 for degradation in response to Wnt. CRBN is required for physiological Wnt signaling, as modulation of CRBN in zebrafish and Drosophila yields Wnt-driven phenotypes. These studies demonstrate an IMiD-independent, Wnt-driven mechanism of CRBN regulation and provide a means of controlling Wnt pathway activity by CRBN, with relevance for development and disease.","10.1038/s41467-021-25634-z",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
10783,"Chloride intracellular channel 1 activity is not required for glioblastoma development but its inhibition dictates glioma stem cell responsivity to novel biguanide derivatives.; Biguanide derivatives and CLIC1 and GBM organoids and Glioblastoma stem cells and Targeted therapy; BACKGROUND: Chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) activity controls glioblastoma proliferation. Metformin exerts antitumor effects in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) inhibiting CLIC1 activity, but its low potency hampers its translation in clinical settings. METHODS: We synthesized a small library of novel biguanide-based compounds that were tested as antiproliferative agents for GSCs derived from human glioblastomas, in vitro using 2D and 3D cultures and in vivo in the zebrafish model. Compounds were compared to metformin for both potency and efficacy in the inhibition of GSC proliferation in vitro (MTT, Trypan blue exclusion assays, and EdU labeling) and in vivo (zebrafish model), migration (Boyden chamber assay), invasiveness (Matrigel invasion assay), self-renewal (spherogenesis assay), and CLIC1 activity (electrophysiology recordings), as well as for the absence of off-target toxicity (effects on normal stem cells and toxicity for zebrafish and chick embryos). RESULTS: We identified Q48 and Q54 as two novel CLIC1 blockers, characterized by higher antiproliferative potency than metformin in vitro, in both GSC 2D cultures and 3D spheroids. Q48 and Q54 also impaired GSC self-renewal, migration and invasion, and displayed low systemic in vivo toxicity. Q54 reduced in vivo proliferation of GSCs xenotransplanted in zebrafish hindbrain. Target specificity was confirmed by recombinant CLIC1 binding experiments using microscale thermophoresis approach. Finally, we characterized GSCs from GBMs spontaneously expressing low CLIC1 protein, demonstrating their ability to grow in vivo and to retain stem-like phenotype and functional features in vitro. In these GSCs, Q48 and Q54 displayed reduced potency and efficacy as antiproliferative agents as compared to high CLIC1-expressing tumors. However, in 3D cultures, metformin and Q48 (but not Q54) inhibited proliferation, which was dependent on the inhibition dihydrofolate reductase activity. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight that, while CLIC1 is dispensable for the development of a subset of glioblastomas, it acts as a booster of proliferation in the majority of these tumors and its functional expression is required for biguanide antitumor class-effects. In particular, the biguanide-based derivatives Q48 and Q54, represent the leads to develop novel compounds endowed with better pharmacological profiles than metformin, to act as CLIC1-blockers for the treatment of CLIC1-expressing glioblastomas, in a precision medicine approach.","10.1186/s13046-021-02213-0",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
10817,"Roles for cytosolic NADPH redox in regulating pulmonary artery relaxation by thiol oxidation-elicited subunit dimerization of protein kinase G1.; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and hypoxia and thioredoxin; The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) appears to control a vascular smooth muscle relaxing mechanism regulated through cytosolic NADPH oxidation. Since our recent studies suggest that thiol oxidation-elicited dimerization of the 1 form of protein kinase G (PKG1) contributes to the relaxation of isolated endothelium-removed bovine pulmonary arteries (BPA) to peroxide and responses to hypoxia, we investigated whether cytosolic NADPH oxidation promoted relaxation by PKG1 dimerization. Relaxation of BPA to G6PD inhibitors 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) and epiandrosterone (studied under hypoxia to minimize basal levels of NADPH oxidation and PKG1 dimerization) was associated with increased PKG1 dimerization and PKG-mediated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation. Depletion of PKG1 by small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) inhibited relaxation of BPA to 6-AN and attenuated the increase in VASP phosphorylation. Relaxation to 6-AN did not appear to be altered by depletion of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Depletion of G6PD, thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), and Trx reductase-1 (TrxR-1) in BPA with siRNA increased PKG1 dimerization and VASP phosphorylation and inhibited force generation under aerobic and hypoxic conditions. Depletion of TrxR-1 with siRNA inhibited the effects of 6-AN and enhanced similar responses to peroxide. Peroxiredoxin-1 depletion by siRNA inhibited PKG dimerization to peroxide, but it did not alter PKG dimerization under hypoxia or the stimulation of dimerization by 6-AN. Thus regulation of cytosolic NADPH redox by G6PD appears to control PKG1 dimerization in BPA through its influence on Trx-1 redox regulation by the NADPH dependence of TrxR-1. NADPH regulation of PKG dimerization may contribute to vascular responses to hypoxia that are associated with changes in NADPH redox.","10.1152/ajpheart.01010.2011",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
11301,"Nafamostat mesylate as a broad-spectrum candidate for the treatment of flavivirus infections by targeting envelope proteins; Antiviral;  Envelope protein;  Flavivirus;  Nafamostat;  Zika virus; Epidemics caused by flaviviruses occur globally; however, no antiviral drugs treating flaviviruses infections have yet been developed. Nafamostat (NM) is a protease inhibitor approved for pancreatitis and anti-coagulation. The anti-flavivirus potential of NM has yet to be determined. Here, utilizing in vitro and in vivo infection assays, we present that NM effectively inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) and other flaviviruses in vitro. NM inhibited the production of ZIKV viral RNA and proteins originating from Asia and African lineage in human-, mouse- and monkey-derived cell lines and the in vivo anti-ZIKV efficacy of NM was verified. Mode-of-action analysis using time-of-drug-addition assay, infectivity inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance assay, and molecular docking revealed that NM interacted with viral particles and blocked the early stage of infection by targeting the domain III of ZIKV envelope protein. Analysing the anti-flavivirus effects of NM-related compounds suggested that the antiviral effect depended on the unique structure of NM. These findings suggest the potential use of NM as an anti-flavivirus candidate, and a novel drug design approach targeting the flavivirus envelope protein.  2022 The Authors","10.1016/j.antiviral.2022.105325",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Pigs are a large animal with similar physiology and immunology to humans and are a natural host for PRCV. Four PRCV strains were investigated and shown to induce different degrees of lung pathology. Importantly, although all four strains replicated equally well in porcine cell lines in vitro and in the upper respiratory tract in vivo, PRCV strains causing more severe lung pathology were also able to replicate in ex vivo tracheal organ cultures as well as in vivo in the trachea and lung. The time course of infection of PRCV 135, which caused the most severe pulmonary pathology, was investigated. Virus was shed from the upper respiratory tract until day 10 post infection, with infection of the respiratory mucosa, as well as olfactory and sustentacular cells, providing an excellent model to study upper respiratory tract disease in addition to the commonly known lower respiratory tract disease from PRCV. Infected animals made antibody and T cell responses that cross reacted with the four PRCV strains and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus. The antibody response was reproduced in vitro in organ cultures. Comparison of mechanisms of infection and immune control in pigs infected with PRCVs of differing pathogenicity with human data from SARS-CoV-2 infection and from our in vitro organ cultures, will enable key events in coronavirus infection and disease pathogenesis to be identified.

Here, we employed an iterative multiscale computational modeling and quantitative experimental approach to decouple direct and indirect effects of actomyosin-generated forces, nuclear positioning, extracellular matrix, and cell-cell adhesion in shaping Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Basally generated actomyosin forces generate epithelial bending of the wing disc pouch. Surprisingly, acute pharmacological inhibition of ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility does not impact the maintenance of tissue height or curved shape. Computational simulations show that ECM tautness provides only a minor contribution to modulating tissue shape. Instead, passive ECM pre-strain serves to maintain the shape independent from actomyosin contractility. These results provide general insight into how the subcellular forces are generated and maintained within individual cells to induce tissue curvature. Thus, the results suggest an important design principle of separable contributions from ECM prestrain and actomyosin tension during epithelial organogenesis and homeostasis.  2020 Nematbakhsh et al","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008105",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"yes"

Although translocation is due in part to a disintegration of the intestinal epithelial barrier, there is a bias towards the translocation of Proteobacteria. We hypothesized that intestinal epithelial microvesicle cargo differs after HIV infection and contributes to biased translocation. We isolated gastrointestinal luminal microvesicles before and after progressive simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaques and measured miRNA and antimicrobial peptide content. We demonstrate that these microvesicles display decreased miR-28-5p, -484, -584-3p, and -584-5p, and let-7b-3p, as well as increased beta-defensin 1 after SIV infection. We further observed dose-dependent growth sensitivity of commensal Lactobacillus salivarius upon co-culture with isolated microvesicles. Infection-associated microvesicle differences were not mirrored in non-progressively SIV-infected sooty mangabeys. Our findings describe novel alterations of antimicrobial control after progressive SIV infection that influence the growth of translocating bacterial taxa.

Despite its involvement in regulating apical proteins, the role of MYO5B in cell polarity is less clear. Inactivating mutations in MYO5B result in microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), a disorder characterized by loss of key apical transporters and the presence of intracellular inclusions in enterocytes. We previously identified that inclusions in Myo5b knockout (KO) mice form from invagination of the apical brush border via apical bulk endocytosis. Herein, we sought to elucidate the role of polarity complexes and tight junction proteins during the formation of inclusions. Methods: Intestinal tissue from neonatal control and Myo5b KO littermates was analyzed by immunofluorescence to determine the localization of polarity complexes and tight junction proteins. Results: Proteins that make up the apical polarity complexes-Crumbs3 and Pars complexes-were associated with inclusions in Myo5b KO mice. In addition, tight junction proteins were observed to be concentrated over inclusions that were present at the apical membrane of Myo5b-deficient enterocytes in vivo and in vitro. Our mouse findings are complemented by immunostaining in a large animal swine model of MVID genetically engineered to express a human MVID-associated mutation that shows an accumulation of Claudin-2 over forming inclusions. The findings from our swine model of MVID suggest that a similar mechanism of tight junction accumulation occurs in patients with MVID. Conclusions: These data show that apical bulk endocytosis involves the altered localization of apical polarity proteins and tight junction proteins after loss of Myo5b.  2021 The Authors","10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.01.022",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

The researchers captured fawns and pregnant females at several distinct physiographic regions in Mississippi, and then relocated the animals to a controlled habitat. Under standardized environmental conditions, the body mass and antler size of the deer was recorded over two generations. The results showed that the phenotypic variation of deer is more strongly related to nutritional factors than population-level genetics. From creatures great to creatures small, our next video highlight from JoVE Biology looks at zebrafish neural crest development. Here, our Authors use live embryos to track migrating stem cells in real-time. The zebrafish is an emerging model for such studies due to the similarity of their eye development to their mammalian counterparts. Using multi-photon time-lapse imaging, real-time videos of developing zebrafish eyes can help scientists understand how disruptions in the development of the neural crest can cause congenital eye and craniofacial anomalies. This technique can also be applied to visualizing the development of other tissues. Our next video article also explores the generation of new tissues - but artificially. In JoVE Bioengineering, our Authors showcase their method for engineering vascularized tissues and organoids. Using a novel variation of microfluidic bioprinting, the researchers create a microfibrous scaffold that can be populated by epithelial cells. Over a period of several days, these encapsulated cells can form lumen-like structures, which resemble vasculature. This endothelialized scaffold can then be used as a vascular bed, and seeding with secondary cell types can produce new vascularized tissue. And I cant even get my printer to connect to wifi. Finally this month, JoVE Neuroscience highlights promising developments for patients with disorders of consciousness. Here, our Authors demonstrate a suite of hybrid Brain-Computer interface-based paradigms that can assess the level of consciousness of people unable to provide motor response and then establish communication. Using electroencephalography, to monitor brain activity, the researchers presented tasks requiring patients to concentrate on certain stimuli or movements. In multiple cases, the data showed that patients were able to complete the assignments, giving hope for clear channels of communication in the near future.

11542,"Characterization of porcine intestinal enteroid cultures under a lipopolysaccharide challenge; Claudin 4;  Early endosome antigen 1;  Enteroid;  Pig;  Toll-like receptor 4; Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) located in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria are recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This interaction initiates a proinflammatory response that antagonizes pig performance and increases morbidity and mortality. Understanding this signaling cascade in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs has relied heavily on cell lines isolated several decades ago. Therefore, we produced and characterized a porcine intestinal enteriod model to study the impact a LPS challenge has on TLR4 localization. Modifying protocols used to isolate porcine, murine, and human intestinal epithelial stem cells (IESC), we were able to isolate porcine IESC. After 7 to 10 d of culturing the IESC, 3-dimensional intestinal enteroid structures were identified. These intestinal enteroids were characterized via immunofluorescent markers (villin, chromogranin A, and claudin 4) and were shown to contain enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells and form tight junctions. After 14 to 16 d of culture, porcine intestinal enteroids underwent a 24-h LPS challenge (10 g/mL) to study the localization of TLR4. Control intestinal enteroids showed TLR4 disbursed throughout the cells, whereas localization was more punctate in LPS-treated intestinal enteroids. Co-staining with the early endosome marker early endosome antigen 1 showed increased internalization and colocalization of TLR4 with early endosome antigen 1 after LPS exposure (P = 0.03). In conclusion, porcine intestinal enteroids were responsive to a LPS challenge, which resulted in the internalization of TLR4 to the early endosome, and these enteroids cultures may be a viable model for understanding intestinal inflammation and receptor localization.  2016 American Society of Animal Science.

Reaggregates from E6 embryonic chicken retina exhibit areas corresponding to an inner plexiform layer (IPL), which presents an ideal in vitro model to test conditions and constraints of cholinergic and glutamatergic network formation, providing a basis for retinal tissue engineering. Here, we show that ipl formation is regulated by cholinergic starburst amacrine cells (SACs), a glial scaffold and by L-glutamate. METHODS. Rosetted spheroids were cultured in absence or presence of 0.2 to 0.4 mM L-glutamate and analyzed by immuno- and enzyme histochemistry, proliferation, and apoptosis assays. RESULTS. After 2 days in vitro (div), ipl formation was announced by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) cells. Individual vimentin or transitin Mller glial cell precursors (MCPs) in ipl centers coexpressed ChAT. Comparable to in vivo, pairwise arranged ChAT SACs formed two laminar subbands. Projections of calretinin amacrine cells (ACs) into ipl associated with MCP processes. In L-glutamate-, or NMDA-treated spheroids ipls were disrupted, including loss of SACs and MCs; coincubation with NMDA receptor inhibitor MK-801 prevented these effects. Also, many Pax6 cells, comprising most ACs, were lost, while rho4D2 rod photoreceptors were increased. Cell proliferation was slightly increased, while apoptosis remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS. This demonstrated: (1) a far-advanced differentiation of an IPL in retinal spheroids, as never described before; (2) ipl sublamination was initiated by cholinergic precursor cells, which-functioning as ipl founder cells-(3) gave rise to neurons and glial cells; (4) these SACs and MCPs together organized ipl formation; and (5) this process was counteracted by NMDA-dependent glutamate actions.

11577,"Mask family proteins ankhd1 and ankrd17 regulate yap nuclear import and stability; NA; Mask family proteins were discovered in Drosophila to promote the activity of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki), the sole fly homolog of mammalian YAP (YAP1) and TAZ (WWTR1). The molecular function of Mask, or its mammalian homologs Mask1 (ANKHD1) and Mask2 (ANKRD17), remains unclear. Mask family proteins contain two ankyrin repeat domains that bind Yki/YAP as well as a conserved nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and nuclear export sequence (NES), suggesting a role in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Here we show that Mask acts to promote nuclear import of Yki, and that addition of an ectopic NLS to Yki is sufficient to bypass the requirement for Mask in Yki-driven tissue growth. Mammalian Mask1/2 proteins also promote nuclear import of YAP, as well as stabilising YAP and driving formation of liquid droplets.

11613,"Conservation of genetic resources in horse breeding and major structural damages of sperm during semen cryopreservation in stallions; NA; Assisted reproductive technologies have been used in zoos and breeding centres to preserve rare and endangered species of wild animals over the past three decades. The most common way to preserve the genetic material of farm and wildlife animals is to create cryobanks of semen producers and embryos. Studies of domestic species under controlled conditions provide an excellent opportunity to develop effective semen handling techniques for application to wild species of the genus Equus. The All-Russian Research Institute for Horse Breeding (ARRIH) began studies on the cryopreservation of genetic resources in the early 1950s. In 1954 the ARRIH got the worlds first foal from the artificial insemination by cryopreserved sperm. The collection of genetic resources of ARRIH has been successfully working since 1972 and contains nowadays cryo-preserved sperm from 56 stallions of 16 breeds of domestic and foreign selections. Freezing and subsequent thawing of stallion sperm leads to a decrease in progressive sperm motility and an increase in the number of sperm with structural pathologies. Electron microscopy is one of the most accurate methods used to assess the structural integrity of sperm. We conducted an electron microscopic study of native and cryopreserved sperm of 35 stallions of riding and trotting breeds, aged 4 to 22 years (mean age 11.3  0.9 years). We found that organoids with a denser structure are more resistant to freezing and subsequent thawing of sperm. The use of stallion sperm cryopreservation according to the standard technology of ARRIH leads to a decrease in the number of sperms with intact heads by an average of 19.7%, and the share of sperm with intact heads in cryopreserved sperm is 49.1  2.7% (p < 0.001). The most negatively cryopreservation of semen affects an acrosome of sperms. The main pathologies of acrosomes in sperm cryopreservation are acrosome hypoplasia and its degradation (secondary absence of acrosome). The number of spermatozoa with acrosome hypoplasia and the absence of internal content after cryopreservation increases by 20.9%, and the share of such sperms is 31.7% in thawed sperm (p < 0.001). The number of sperm with acrosome degradation during sperm freezing and thawing increases by 10.4%, and is 18.6  2.4% in average. The share of spermatozoa with normal mito-chondrial structure in native sperm is 89.3  2.0% in average, in cryopreserved sperm - decreases by 6.5%. The share of spermatozoa with normal axoneme after cryopreservation decreases slowly, averaging by 4.4% and is 81.4  2.0%.

However, limited entry of nutrients and cells inside the scaffold can lead to poor cell survival and proliferation, and scaffold implantation can require an invasive surgical approach. Here, a noninvasive method using injectable 3D porous micro-scaffolds with a bio-engine is developed for cell transplantation and tissue regeneration. A liquid nitrogen flash-frozen and immediately smashed method is developed to prepare 3D porous nanocarriers-alginate composite micro-scaffolds (NAC/MS). Compared to common scaffolds, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) grown in NAC/MS show high survival and proliferation rates; this is due to the small size of the micro-scaffolds, which allows access to nutrients. Bio-factors are loaded into nanocarriers to produce a bio-engine that can initiate and promote stem cells differentiation in a bionic manner, behaving like an engine. Transplanted hMSCs show significantly enhanced expansion and mineralization in vivo. Furthermore, NAC/MS can promote in situ regeneration of bone in cranial defects in dogs. The biomimetic NAC/MS provide an injectable niche to cell survival, proliferation, and fate control during tissue regeneration or cell therapy, which are critical for developing organoid culture devices and cells local delivery vehicles.  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we show that vasculature of kidney explants grafted onto CAM is very different from natural kidney vasculature, showing excessive growth of endothelial cells, absence of a hierarchical arteriovenous network and no vascular smooth muscle cell recruitment. The model therefore has serious limits.","10.1242/bio.059459",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

We created a scalable hydrogel dish design to facilitate scaffold-free formation of multiple spheroids in a single dish. Our novel design features inner and outer walls, allowing efficient media changes and downstream experiments. The design is easily scalable, accommodating varying numbers of microwells per plate. We report that non-adherent hydrogel stiffness affects spheroid morphology and compaction. We found that spheroid morphology and viability in our hydrogel dishes were comparable to commercially available Aggrewell (TM) 800 plates, with improved tunability of surface stiffness and imaging area. Device function was demonstrated with a migration assay using two investigational inhibitors against EMT. We successfully maintained primary-derived spheroids from murine and porcine lungs in the hydrogel dish.

Research has focused mostly on genetically modified mice, although other species like pigs resemble the human physiology more closely. In addition, cross-species comparisons with phylogenetically distant species such as chickens provide powerful insights into fundamental biological and biomedical processes. One of the most versatile genetic methods applicable across species is CRISPR-Cas9. Here, we report the generation of transgenic chickens and pigs that constitutively express Cas9 in all organs. These animals are healthy and fertile. Functionality of Cas9 was confirmed in both species for a number of different target genes, for a variety of cell types and in vivo by targeted gene disruption in lymphocytes and the developing brain, and by precise excision of a 12.7-kb DNA fragment in the heart. The Cas9 transgenic animals will provide a powerful resource for in vivo genome editing for both agricultural and translational biomedical research, and will facilitate reverse genetics as well as cross-species comparisons.","10.1073/pnas.2022562118",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

ZIKV infection may result in severe syndromes such as neurological complications and microcephaly in newborns. Therefore, ZIKV has become a global public health threat and currently there is no approved specific drug for its treatment. Animal venoms are important resources of novel drugs. Cathelicidin-BF (BF-30) is a defensive peptide identified fromBungarus fasciatussnake venom and has been shown to be an excellent template for applicable peptide design. In this study, we found that ZY13, one of the peptidic analogs of BF-30, inhibits ZIKV infectionin vitroandin vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that ZY13 can directly inactivate ZIKV and reduce the production of infectious virions. Further studies also indicated that administration of ZY13 strengthen the host antiviral immunity via AXL-SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling protein) pathway. Additionally, the results of mouse experiment suggest that ZY13 efficiently restrict ZIKV infection and improve the growth defects of ZIKV-infected mouse pups. Together, our findings not only demonstrate that ZY13 might be a candidate for anti-ZIKV drug, but also indicated the importance of animal venom peptides as templates for antivirals development.","10.3389/fmicb.2020.01871",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

The increasing incidence of retinal degeneration has triggered research into the development of in vitro retinal models for drug development and retinal alternatives for transplantation. However, the complex retinal structure and the retinal microenvironment pose serious challenges. Although 3D cell printing technology has been widely used in tissue engineering, including in vitro model development and regeneration medicine, currently available bioinks are insufficient to recapitulate the complex extracellular matrix environment of the retina. Therefore, in this study, we developed a retinal decellularized extracellular matrix (RdECM) from the porcine retina and evaluated its characteristics. The RdECM conserved the ECM components from the native retina without cellular components. Then, we mixed the RdECM with collagen to form a bioink and confirmed its suitability for 3D cell printing. We further studied the effect of the RdECM bioink on the differentiation of Muller cells. The retinal protective effect of the RdECM bioink was confirmed through a retinal degeneration animal model. Thus, we believe that the RdECM bioink is a promising candidate for retinal tissue engineering.","10.3390/pharmaceutics13070934",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
12196,"Slack Length Reduces the Contractile Phenotype of the Swine Carotid Artery; Actin polymerization; Paxillin; Myosin; MicroRNA; Contraction is the primary function of adult arterial smooth muscle. However, in response to vessel injury or inflammation, arterial smooth muscle is able to phenotypically modulate from the contractile state to several `synthetic' states characterized by proliferation, migration and/or increased cytokine secretion. We examined the effect of tissue length (L) on the phenotype of intact, isometrically held, initially contractile swine carotid artery tissues. Tissues were studied (1) without prolonged incubation at the optimal length for force generation (1.0 Lo, control), (2) with prolonged incubation for 17 h at 1.0 Lo, or (3) with prolonged incubation at slack length (0.6 Lo) for 16 h and then restoration to 1.0 Lo for 1 h. Prolonged incubation at 1.0 Lo minimally reduced the contractile force without substantially altering the mediators of contraction (crossbridge phosphorylation, shortening velocity or stimulated actin polymerization). Prolonged incubation of tissues at slack length (0.6 Lo), despite return of length to 1.0 Lo, substantially reduced contractile force, reduced crossbridge phosphorylation, nearly abolished crossbridge cycling (shortening velocity) and abolished stimulated actin polymerization. These data suggest that (1) slack length treatment significantly alters the contractile phenotype of arterial tissue, and (2) slack length treatment is a model to study acute phenotypic modulation of intact arterial smooth muscle.

An intestinal epithelial in vitro model can help to understand how enterocytes are affected by these factors and contribute to the development of strategies against pathogens. Results The present study describes a novel method to culture and maintain primary chicken enterocytes and their characterization by immunofluorescence and biomolecular approaches. Starting from 19-day-old chicken embryos it was possible to isolate viable intestinal cell aggregates that can expand and produce a self-maintaining intestinal epithelial cell population that survives until 12 days in culture. These cells resulted positive in immunofluorescence to Cytokeratin 18, Zonula occludens 1, Villin, and Occludin that are common intestinal epithelial markers, and negative to Vimentin that is expressed by endothelial cells. Cells were cultured also on Transwell (R) permeable supports and trans-epithelial electrical resistance, was measured. This value gradually increased reaching 64 omega{*}cm(2) 7 days after seeding and it remained stable until day 12. Conclusions Based on these results it was confirmed that it is possible to isolate and maintain chicken intestinal epithelial cells in culture and that they can be suitable as in vitro intestinal model for further studies.","10.1186/s12860-021-00349-7",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"

Also lacking is information about the susceptibility and the pathogenesis of the developing inner ear following Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. To address this, ZIKV was delivered directly into the otic cup/otocyst of chicken embryos and infection of inner ear tissues was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Results After injections on embryonic days 2 to 5, ZIKV infection was observed in 90\% of the samples harvested 2 to 8 days later; however, the degree of infection was highly variable across individuals. ZIKV was detected in all regions of the inner ear, associated ganglia, and in the surrounding periotic mesenchyme. Detection of virus peaked earlier in the ganglion and vestibular compartments, and later in the cochlea. ZIKV infection increased cell death robustly in the auditory ganglion, and modestly in the auditory sensory organ. Macrophage accumulation was found to overlap with dense viral infection in some tissues. Additionally, dysmorphogenesis of the semicircular canals and ganglion was observed for a subset of injection conditions. Conclusions This article presents evidence of direct ZIKV infection of developing inner ear epithelium and shows previously unknown inner ear dysmorphogenesis phenotypes.","10.1002/dvdy.176",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"yes"
12280,"A Comparative Oncology Drug Discovery Pipeline to Identify and Validate New Treatments for Osteosarcoma; comparative oncology; patient-derived xenografts; precision medicine; CRM1; proteasome; sarcoma; Simple Summary Osteosarcoma is a rare bone cancer that occurs primarily in children. The discovery of new treatments for osteosarcoma and other rare cancer types has been severely limited by access to patient samples to study these often-complex diseases. Here we capitalize on naturally-occurring cancers in pet dogs to study the biology of these rare cancers. Using living cells from canine and human patients to test thousands of drugs simultaneously, we identify a unique combination of drugs that disrupts protein degradation and protein trafficking in cancer cells. This drug combination represents a promising new treatment to treat both dogs and people with osteosarcoma. Background: Osteosarcoma is a rare but aggressive bone cancer that occurs primarily in children. Like other rare cancers, treatment advances for osteosarcoma have stagnated, with little improvement in survival for the past several decades. Developing new treatments has been hampered by extensive genomic heterogeneity and limited access to patient samples to study the biology of this complex disease. Methods: To overcome these barriers, we combined the power of comparative oncology with patient-derived models of cancer and high-throughput chemical screens in a cross-species drug discovery pipeline. Results: Coupling in vitro high-throughput drug screens on low-passage and established cell lines with in vivo validation in patient-derived xenografts we identify the proteasome and CRM1 nuclear export pathways as therapeutic sensitivities in osteosarcoma, with dual inhibition of these pathways inducing synergistic cytotoxicity. Conclusions: These collective efforts provide an experimental framework and set of new tools for osteosarcoma and other rare cancers to identify and study new therapeutic vulnerabilities.","10.3390/cancers12113335",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
12283,"Luminal and Glandular Epithelial Cells from the Porcine Endometrium maintain Cell Type-Specific Marker Gene Expression in Air-Liquid Interface Culture; Endometrium; Glandular epithelium; Luminal epithelium; Air-liquid interface; Cell culture; Two different types of epithelial cells constitute the inner surface of the endometrium. While luminal epithelial cells line the uterine cavity and build the embryo-maternal contact zone, glandular epithelial cells form tubular glands reaching deeply into the endometrial stroma. To facilitate investigations considering the functional and molecular differences between the two populations of epithelial cells and their contribution to reproductive processes, we aimed at establishing differentiated in vitro models of both the luminal and the glandular epithelium of the porcine endometrium using an air-liquid interface (ALI) approach. We first tested if porcine luminal endometrium epithelial cells (PEEC-L) reproducibly form differentiated epithelial monolayers under ALI conditions by monitoring the morphology and the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Subsequently, luminal (PEEC-L) and glandular epithelial cells (PEEC-G) were consecutively isolated from the endometrium of the uterine horn. Both cell types were characterized by marker gene expression analysis immediately after isolation. Cells were separately grown at the ALI and assessed by means of histomorphometry, TEER, and marker gene expression after 3 weeks of culture. PEEC-L and PEEC-G formed polarized monolayers of differentiated epithelial cells with a moderate TEER and in vivo-like morphology at the ALI. They exhibited distinct patterns of functional and cell type-specific marker gene expression after isolation and largely maintained these patterns during the culture period. The here presented cell culture procedure for PEEC-L and -G offers new opportunities to study the impact of embryonic signals, endocrine effectors, and reproductive toxins on both porcine endometrial epithelial cell types under standardized in vitro conditions.","10.1007/s12015-022-10410-3",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
12287,"Regulation of prefrontal patterning and connectivity by retinoic acid; NA; The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections with the mediodorsal thalamus are crucial for cognitive flexibility and working memory(1) and are thought to be altered in disorders such as autism(2,3) and schizophrenia(4,5). Although developmental mechanisms that govern the regional patterning of the cerebral cortex have been characterized in rodents(6-9), the mechanisms that underlie the development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity and the lateral expansion of the PFC with a distinct granular layer 4 in primates(10,11) remain unknown. Here we report an anterior (frontal) to posterior (temporal), PFC-enriched gradient of retinoic acid, a signalling molecule that regulates neural development and function(12-15), and we identify genes that are regulated by retinoic acid in the neocortex of humans and macaques at the early and middle stages of fetal development. We observed several potential sources of retinoic acid, including the expression and cortical expansion of retinoic-acid-synthesizing enzymes specifically in primates as compared to mice. Furthermore, retinoic acid signalling is largely confined to the prospective PFC by CYP26B1, a retinoic-acid-catabolizing enzyme, which is upregulated in the prospective motor cortex. Genetic deletions in mice revealed that retinoic acid signalling through the retinoic acid receptors RXRG and RARB, as well as CYP26B1-dependent catabolism, are involved in proper molecular patterning of prefrontal and motor areas, development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity, intra-PFC dendritic spinogenesis and expression of the layer 4 marker RORB. Together, these findings show that retinoic acid signalling has a critical role in the development of the PFC and, potentially, in its evolutionary expansion.","10.1038/s41586-021-03953-x",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
12313,"Blood Flow Regulates Glomerular Capillary Formation in Zebrafish Pronephros; NA; Background The renal glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries in Bowman's capsule and functions as a blood-filtration unit in the kidney. The unique glomerular capillary tuft structure is relatively conserved through vertebrate species. However, the morphogenetic mechanism governing glomerular capillary tuft formation remains elusive. Methods To clarify how glomerular capillaries develop, we analyzed glomerular capillary formation in the zebrafish pronephros by exploiting fluorescence-based bio-imaging technology. Results During glomerular capillary formation in the zebrafish pronephros, endothelial cells initially sprouted from the dorsal aorta and formed the capillaries surrounding the bilateral glomerular primordia in response to podocyte progenitor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor-A. After formation, blood flow immediately occurred in the glomerular primordia-associated capillaries, while in the absence of blood flow, they were transformed into sheet-like structures enveloping the glomerular primordia. Subsequently, blood flow induced formation of Bowman's space at the lateral sides of the bilateral glomerular primordia. Concomitantly, podocyte progenitors enveloped their surrounding capillaries while moving toward and coalescing at the midline. These capillaries then underwent extensive expansion and remodeling to establish a functional glomerular capillary tuft. However, stopping blood flow inhibited the remodeling of bilateral glomerular primordia, which therefore remained unvascularized but covered by the vascular sheets. Conclusions We delineated the morphogenetic processes governing glomerular capillary tuft formation in the zebrafish pronephros and demonstrated crucial roles of blood flow in its formation. Blood flow maintains tubular structures of the capillaries surrounding the glomerular primordia and promotes glomerular incorporation of these vessels by inducing the remodeling of glomerular primordia.","10.34067/kid.0005962021",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
12331,"Development of Intestinal Scaffolds that Mimic Native Mammalian Intestinal Tissue; intestinal tissue engineering; artificial intestine; functional tissue engineering with intestinal scaffolds; poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffold biomechanics; biodegradable polymers; short bowel syndrome; The goal of this study was to develop a scaffold for the generation of an artificial intestine that specifically mimics the architecture and biomechanical properties of the native small intestine, and to evaluate the scaffold in vitro and in vivo. Scaffolds mimicking the microarchitecture of native intestine were fabricated from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) with a thickness of 647 mu m (+/- 241 mu m) and villus height of 340 mu m (+/- 29.5 mu m). The scaffolds showed excellent biological properties, as 71.4\% (+/- 7.2\%) and 58.7\% (+/- 12.7\%) mass remained after 5 weeks of in vitro exposure to control and digestive media, respectively. Tensile properties of the scaffolds approached those of native porcine intestine and scaffolds maintained their mechanical properties over 6 weeks based on rheometer measurements. Scaffolds accommodated intestinal epithelial stem cells and demonstrated maintenance of size and microarchitecture after 12 weeks of omental implantation in mice. There was an expected amount of inflammation, but less tissue infiltration and tissue formation than anticipated. In conclusion, we developed novel scaffolds using PGS that mimic the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of native intestine with promise for use in artificial intestine for individuals with short bowel syndrome. Graphical abstract Impact Statement This study is significant because it demonstrates an attempt to design a scaffold specifically for small intestine using a novel fabrication method, resulting in an architecture that resembles intestinal villi. In addition, we use the versatile polymer poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for artificial intestine, which has tunable mechanical and degradation properties that can be harnessed for further fine-tuning of scaffold design. Moreover, the utilization of PGS allows for future development of growth factor and drug delivery from the scaffolds to promote artificial intestine formation.","10.1089/ten.tea.2018.0239",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
12357,"WNT Activation and TGF beta-Smad Inhibition Potentiate Stemness of Mammalian Auditory Neuroprogenitors for High-Throughput Generation of Functional Auditory Neurons In Vitro; otic progenitors; auditory neuroprogenitors; auditory neurons; auditory progenitors stemness; auditory neuron regeneration; in vitro model; 3R; Hearing loss affects over 460 million people worldwide and is a major socioeconomic burden. Both genetic and environmental factors (i.e., noise overexposure, ototoxic drug treatment and ageing), promote the irreversible degeneration of cochlear hair cells and associated auditory neurons, leading to sensorineural hearing loss. In contrast to birds, fish and amphibians, the mammalian inner ear is virtually unable to regenerate due to the limited stemness of auditory progenitors, and no causal treatment is able to prevent or reverse hearing loss. As of today, a main limitation for the development of otoprotective or otoregenerative therapies is the lack of efficient preclinical models compatible with high-throughput screening of drug candidates. Currently, the research field mainly relies on primary organotypic inner ear cultures, resulting in high variability, low throughput, high associated costs and ethical concerns. We previously identified and characterized the phoenix auditory neuroprogenitors (ANPGs) as highly proliferative progenitor cells isolated from the A/J mouse cochlea. In the present study, we aim at identifying the signaling pathways responsible for the intrinsic high stemness of phoenix ANPGs. A transcriptomic comparison of traditionally low-stemness ANPGs, isolated from C57Bl/6 and A/J mice at early passages, and high-stemness phoenix ANPGs was performed, allowing the identification of several differentially expressed pathways. Based on differentially regulated pathways, we developed a reprogramming protocol to induce high stemness in presenescent ANPGs (i.e., from C57Bl6 mouse). The pharmacological combination of the WNT agonist (CHIR99021) and TGF beta/Smad inhibitors (LDN193189 and SB431542) resulted in a dramatic increase in presenescent neurosphere growth, and the possibility to expand ANPGs is virtually limitless. As with the phoenix ANPGs, stemness-induced ANPGs could be frozen and thawed, enabling distribution to other laboratories. Importantly, even after 20 passages, stemness-induced ANPGs retained their ability to differentiate into electrophysiologically mature type I auditory neurons. Both stemness-induced and phoenix ANPGs resolve a main bottleneck in the field, allowing efficient, high-throughput, low-cost and 3R-compatible in vitro screening of otoprotective and otoregenerative drug candidates. This study may also add new perspectives to the field of inner ear regeneration.","10.3390/cells11152431",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

The concept of personalized medicine has emerged in the last years with the objective to tailor the medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient, and particularly to the tumor biology of each patient. The need for in-vivo xenotransplantation models for cancer patients has increased exponentially, and for this reason zebrafish avatars have gained popularity. Preliminary studies were conducted also with PDAC tissue. AIM To develop a simple, not expensive, diffusible zebrafish embryo model as avatar for patients affected by PDAC. METHODS Tumor tissue was taken from the surgical specimen by the histopathologist. After its fragmentation into small pieces, they are stained with CM-Dil. Small pieces of stained tissue were transplanted into the yolk of wt AB zebrafish embryos with a glass capillary needle. Embryos were incubated at 35 degrees C in E3 medium supplemented with 1\% Pen/Strep in the presence or absence of drugs for the following days in respect of the treatment plan (Gemcitabine; Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin; Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel; 5-Fluorouracil and Folinic acid and Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan). The response of zebrafish xenografts to the chemotherapy options has been analyzed by monitoring the fluorescent stained area at 2 h post injection (hpi), 1 d and 2 d post injection (dpi). In each time point, the mean size of the stained area was measured by ImageJ and it was normalized with respect to the 1 dpi time point mean relative tumor area (RTA). We evaluated the effect of the chemotherapy exposition comparing the mean RTA of each treated subgroup and the control group and evaluating the percentage reduction of the mean RTA by comparing each treated subgroup with the control group. RESULTS Between July 2018 and October 2019, a total of 15 patients with pancreatic cancer were prospectively enrolled. In all cases, it was possible to take a fragment of the tumor from the surgical specimen for the xenotransplantation in the zebrafish embryos. The histological examination confirmed the presence of a PDAC in all cases. In absence of chemotherapy (control group), over time the Dil-stained area showed a statistically significant increase in all cases. A statistically significant reduction of the mean RTA in the treated subgroups for at least one chemotherapy scheme was reported in 6/15 (40\%) cases. The analysis of the percentage reduction of the RTA in treated subgroups in comparison to the control group revealed the presence of a linear relationship in each subgroup between the percentage reduction of the RTA and the number of cases reporting each percentage threshold considered for the analysis. CONCLUSION Our model seems to be effective for the xenotransplantation of PDAC tissue and evaluation of the effect of each chemotherapy scheme on the xenotransplanted tumor tissue.","10.3748/wjg.v26.i21.2792",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"

Herein, via micro-stereolithography 3D printing, we propose and fabricate a ""fish gill"" structure-integrated on-chip membrane device, which has the self-sealing attribute at structure-membrane interface without extra assembling. As a demonstration, metallic micromesh and polymeric membrane can also be easily embedded in 3D printed on-chip device to achieve anti-fouling and anti-clogging functionality for wastewater filtration.

12894,"Sprayable nanomicelle hydrogels and inflammatory bowel disease patient cell chips for development of intestinal lesion-specific therapy.; NA; All-in-one treatments represent a paradigm shift in future medicine. For example, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is mainly diagnosed by endoscopy, which could be applied for not only on-site monitoring but also the intestinal lesion-targeted spray of injectable hydrogels. Furthermore, molecular conjugation to the hydrogels would program both lesion-specific adhesion and drug-free therapy. This study validated this concept of all-in-one treatment by first utilizing a well-known injectable hydrogel that underwent efficient solution-to-gel transition and nanomicelle formation as a translatable component. These properties enabled spraying of the hydrogel onto the intestinal walls during endoscopy. Next, peptide conjugation to the hydrogel guided endoscopic monitoring of IBD progress upon adhesive gelation with subsequent moisturization of inflammatory lesions, specifically by nanomicelles. The peptide was designed to mimic the major component that mediates intestinal interaction with Bacillus subtilis flagellin during IBD initiation. Hence, the peptide-guided efficient adhesion of the hydrogel nanomicelles onto Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) as the main target of flagellin binding and Notch-1. The peptide binding potently suppressed inflammatory signaling without drug loading, where TLR5 and Notch-1 operated collaboratively through downstream actions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

13006,"S16-03 Incorporating organ-on-chip into integrated approaches to testing and assessment; NA; Researchers continue to generate new approach methodologies (NAMs), including methods with increasingly sophisticated technology. When such methods recreate a more accurate physiology, their integration into the regulatory decision-making is of major value. Microphysiological systems such as organ-on-chip (OoC) have been praised for their increased biological relevance. Nevertheless, they are still not used in regulatory decision-making despite the fact of being already utilised in other areas (such as in research and Pharma). One can argue if this is due to their lack of standardisation or to the assumption that OoC data are used in isolation. What if the data generated is part of an integrated process and is weighted for its relevance and the associated uncertainties? Is there enough understanding, confidence and standardization among these systems that would allow using them in an Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA)? IATA is a flexible tool for hazard identification, characterisation and/or safety assessment of a chemical or group of chemicals developed at the OECD to evolve the current regulatory toxicity testing and approaches. Such chemical evaluation results from the integration and translation of the data derived from multiple methods and sources. Besides integrating, this approach also weights all relevant evidence, frames its uncertainty and guides the targeted generation of new data, where required. IATA also puts in vivo data in context with mechanistic studies and at the same time avoids duplication of studies. This not only increases the relevance of the assessment, but it also allows the trustworthy introduction of NAMs. At the Joint Research Centre (JRC) level, EURL ECVAM has been actively involved in several efforts towards the further development and implementation of IATAs. Examples range from the drafting of the overview of concepts and available guidance on IATAs and their components to the participation in the OECD IATA case studies and in the development of specific IATAs for non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) and acute fish toxicity.

13022,"Rose petal topography mimicked poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates for enhanced corneal endothelial cell behavior.; Biomimetic cell substrate and Collagen IV and Corneal endothelium and Hyaluronic acid. and Polydimethylsiloxane and White rose petal; Low proliferation capacity of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) and worldwide limitations in transplantable donor tissues reveal the critical need of a robust approach for in vitro CEC growth. However, preservation of CEC-specific phenotype with increased proliferation has been a great challenge. Here we offer a biomimetic cell substrate design, by optimizing mechanical, topographical and biochemical characteristics of materials with CEC microenvironment. We showed the surprising similarity between topographical features of white rose petals and corneal endothelium due to hexagonal cell shapes and physiologically relevant cell density ( 2000 cells/mm(2)). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with replica of white rose petal topography and cornea-friendly Young's modulus (211.85  74.9 kPa) were functionalized with two of the important corneal extracellular matrix (ECM) components, collagen IV (COL 4) and hyaluronic acid (HA). White rose petal patterned and COL 4 modified PDMS with optimized stiffness provided enhanced bovine CEC response with higher density monolayers and increased phenotypic marker expression. This biomimetic approach demonstrates a successful platform to improve in vitro cell substrate properties of PDMS for corneal applications, suggesting an alternative environment for CEC-based therapies, drug toxicity investigations, microfluidics and organ-on-chip applications.","10.1016/j.msec.2021.112147",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
13091,"Endometrium On-a-Chip Reveals Insulin- And Glucose-induced Alterations in the Transcriptome and Proteomic Secretome; NA; The molecular interactions between the maternal environment and the developing embryo are key for early pregnancy success and are influenced by factors such as maternal metabolic status. Our understanding of the mechanism(s) through which these individual nutritional stressors alter endometrial function and the in utero environment for early pregnancy success is, however, limited. Here we report, for the first time, the use of an endometrium-on-a-chip microfluidics approach to produce a multicellular endometrium in vitro. Isolated endometrial cells (epithelial and stromal) from the uteri of nonpregnant cows in the early luteal phase (Days 4-7) were seeded in the upper chamber of the device (epithelial cells; 4-6 x 104 cells/mL) and stromal cells seeded in the lower chamber (1.5-2 x 104 cells/mL). Exposure of cells to different concentrations of glucose (0.5, 5.0, or 50 mM) or insulin (Vehicle, 1 or 10 ng/mL) was performed at a flow rate of 1 muL/minute for 72 hours. Quantitative differences in the cellular transcriptome and the secreted proteome of in vitro-derived uterine luminal fluid were determined by RNA-sequencing and tandem mass tagging mass spectrometry, respectively. High glucose concentrations altered 21 and 191 protein-coding genes in epithelial and stromal cells, respectively (P < .05), with a dose-dependent quantitative change in the protein secretome (1 and 23 proteins). Altering insulin concentrations resulted in limited transcriptional changes including transcripts for insulin-like binding proteins that were cell specific but altered the quantitative secretion of 196 proteins. These findings highlight 1 potential mechanism by which changes to maternal glucose and insulin alter uterine function.","10.1210/endocr/bqab054",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
13151,"Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived vascular networks to screen nano-bio interactions; NA; The vascular bioactivity/safety of nanomaterials is typically evaluated by animal testing, which is of low throughput and does not account for biological differences between animals and humans such as ageing, metabolism and disease profiles. The development of personalized human in vitro platforms to evaluate the interaction of nanomaterials with the vascular system would be important for both therapeutic and regenerative medicine. A library of 30 nanoparticle (NP) formulations, in use in imaging, antimicrobial and pharmaceutical applications, was evaluated in a reporter zebrafish model of vasculogenesis and then tested in personalized humanized models composed of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived endothelial cells (ECs) with ""young""and ""aged""phenotypes in 3 vascular network formats: 2D (in polystyrene dish), 3D (in Matrigel) and in a blood vessel on a chip. As a proof of concept, vascular toxicity was used as the main readout. The results show that the toxicity profile of NPs to hiPSC-ECs was dependent on the ""age""of the endothelial cells and vascular network format. hiPSC-ECs were less susceptible to the cytotoxicity effect of NPs when cultured in flow than in static conditions, the protective effect being mediated, at least in part, by glycocalyx. Overall, the results presented here highlight the relevance of in vitro hiPSC-derived vascular systems to screen vascular nanomaterial interactions.

High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), an epithelial cancer phenotype, is the most common malignant ovarian cancer. It is known that the precursors of HGSC originate from secretory epithelial cells within the Fallopian tube, which first develops as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC). Here, we used gene editing by CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out the oncogene p53 in dog oviductal epithelia cultured in a dynamic microfluidic chip to create an in vitro model that recapitulated human STIC. Similar to human STIC, the gene-edited oviduct-on-a-chip, exhibited loss of cell polarization and had reduced ciliation, increased cell atypia and proliferation, with multilayered epithelium, increased Ki67, PAX8 and Myc and decreased PTEN and RB1 mRNA expression.

Their de novo production promises significant therapeutic value; however, current in vitro approaches cannot efficiently generate multipotent long-lived HSPCs. Presuming this reflects a lack of extrinsic cues normally impacting the VDA, we devised a human dorsal aorta-on-a-chip platform that identified Yes-activated protein (YAP) as a cyclic stretch-induced regulator of HSPC formation. In the zebrafish VDA, inducible Yap overexpression significantly increased runx1 expression in vivo and the number of CD41(+) HSPCs downstream of HE specification. Endogenous Yap activation by lats1/2 knockdown or Rho-GTPase stimulation mimicked Yap overexpression and induced HSPCs in embryos lacking blood flow. Notably, in static human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived HE culture, compound-mediated YAP activation enhanced RUNX1 levels and hematopoietic colony-forming potential. Together, our findings reveal a potent impact of hemodynamic Rho-YAP mechanotransduction on HE fate, relevant to de novo human HSPC production.","10.1016/j.devcel.2020.01.006",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
13349,"Efficient myotube formation in 3D bioprinted tissue construct by biochemical and topographical cues.; 3D bioprinting and Bioink and Decellularization and Extracellular matrix and Skeletal muscle; Biochemical and biophysical cues directly affect cell morphology, adhesion, proliferation, and phenotype, as well as differentiation; thus, they have been commonly utilized for designing and developing biomaterial systems for tissue engineering applications. To bioengineer skeletal muscle tissues, the efficient and stable formation of aligned fibrous multinucleated myotubes is essential. To achieve this goal, we employed a decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) as a biochemical component and a modified three-dimensional (3D) cell-printing process to produce an in situ uniaxially aligned/micro-topographical structure. The dECM was derived from the decellularization of porcine skeletal muscles and chemically modified by methacrylate process to enhance mechanical stability. By using this ECM-based material and the 3D printing capability, we were able to produce a cell-laden dECM-based structure with unique topographical cues. The myoblasts (C2C12 cell line) laden in the printed structure were aligned and differentiated with a high degree of myotube formation, owing to the synergistic effect of the skeletal muscle-specific biochemical and topographical cues. In particular, the increase of the gene-expression levels of the dECM structure with topographical cues was approximately 1.5-1.8-fold compared with those of a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)-based structure with the same topographical cues and a dECM-based structure without topographical cues. According to these in vitro cellular responses, the 3D printed dECM-based structures with topographical cues have the potential for bioengineering functional skeletal muscle tissues, and this strategy can be extended for many musculoskeletal tissues, such as tendons and ligaments and utilized for developing in vitro tissue-on-a-chip models in drug screening and development.","10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119632",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

13387,"""Liver-on-a-Chip"" Cultures of Primary Hepatocytes and Kupffer Cells for Hepatitis B Virus Infection.; NA; Despite the exceptional infectivity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vivo, where only three viral genomes can result in a chronicity of experimentally infected chimpanzees, most in vitro models require several hundreds to thousands of viral genomes per cell in order to initiate a transient infection. Additionally, static 2D cultures of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) allow only short-term studies due to their rapid dedifferentiation. Here, we describe 3D liver-on-a-chip cultures of PHH, either in monocultures or in cocultures with other nonparenchymal liver-resident cells. These offer a significant improvement to studying long-term HBV infections with physiological host cell responses. In addition to facilitating drug efficacy studies, toxicological analysis, and investigations into pathogenesis, these microfluidic culture systems enable the evaluation of curative therapies for HBV infection aimed at eliminating covalently closed, circular (ccc)DNA. This presented method describes the set-up of PHH monocultures and PHH/Kupffer cell co-cultures, their infection with purified HBV, and the analysis of host responses. This method is particularly applicable to the evaluation of long-term effects of HBV infection, treatment combinations, and pathogenesis.","10.3791/58333",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

This model is based on the reconstruction of the intestinal barrier by culturing two intestinal cell lines from rainbow trout, namely epithelial RTgutGC and fibroblastic RTgutF, in an artificial microenvironment. For a realistic mimicry of the interface between the intestinal lumen and the interior of the organism we i) developed ultrathin and highly porous silicon nitride membranes that serve as basement membrane analogues and provide a culture interface for the fish cells; ii) constructed a unique micro-well plate-based microfluidic bioreactor that enables parallelization of experiments and creates realistic fluid flow exposure scenarios for the cells; iii) integrated electrodes in the reactor for non-invasive impedance sensing of cellular well-being. In a first approach, we used this reactor to investigate the response of epithelial fish cells to in vivo-like shear stress rates of 0.002-0.06 dyne per cm2, resulting from fluid flow within the intestinal lumen. Moreover, we investigated the interplay of epithelial and fibroblast cells under optimal flow conditions to carefully evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of the more complex reconstruction of the intestinal architecture. With our fish-gut-on-chip model we open up new strategies for a better understanding of basic fish physiology, for the refinement of fish feed in aquaculture and for predicting chemical uptake and bioaccumulation in fish for environmental risk assessment. The basic principles of our reactor prototype, including the use of ultrathin membranes, an open microfluidic circuit for perfusion and the micro-well plate-based format for simplified handling and avoidance of air-bubbles, will as well be of great value for other barrier-on-chip models.  2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","10.1039/c9lc00415g",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"

13501,"Evaluation of an ovary-on-a-chip in large mammalian models: Species specificity and influence of follicle isolation status.; NA; The ability to grow oocytes from immature ovarian follicles in vitro has significant potential for fertility preservation; yet, it has proved challenging in large mammalian species due to the complex metabolic needs and long-term culture requirements. Currently, follicular incubations are based on a ""static"" system with manual exchange of medium. Despite the numerous advantages of conventional culturing approaches, recapitulating the native microenvironment and supporting the survival of ovarian follicles from large mammalian species still represent challenges. In this study, we utilized an innovative, dynamic microfluidic system to support the in vitro survival of domestic cat and dog follicles enclosed within the ovarian cortex or isolated from ovarian cortex. Results indicate both species-specific and tissue type-specific differences in response to microfluidic culture. Domestic cat but not dog ovarian cortical tissues maintained viability under flow similar to conventional agarose gel controls. Preantral stage isolated follicles from both species that grew most favourably in conventional alginate bead culture, but overall, there was no influence of culture system on expression of follicle development or oocyte health markers.

Due to a number of disadvantages in terms of quality and reproducibility of in vitro data, animal welfare concerns, and in light of recent cases of fraudulent marketing, the search for alternatives and the development of serum-free medium formulations has gained global attention. Here, we report on the 3rd Workshop on FBS, Serum Alternatives and Serum-free Media, where regulatory aspects, the serum dilemma, alternatives to FBS, case-studies of serum-free in vitro applications, and the establishment of serum-free databases were discussed. The whole process of obtaining blood from a living calf fetus to using the FBS produced from it for scientific purposes is de facto not yet legally regulated despite the existing EU-Directive 2010/63/EU on the use of animals for scientific purposes. Together with the above-mentioned challenges, several strategies have been developed to reduce or replace FBS in cell culture media in terms of the 3Rs (Refinement, Reduction, Replacement).

13652,"Improved bovine embryo production in an oviduct-on-a-chip system: prevention of poly-spermic fertilization and parthenogenic activation.; NA; The oviduct provides the natural micro-environment for gamete interaction, fertilization and early embryo development in mammals, such as the cow. In conventional culture systems, bovine oviduct epithelial cells (BOEC) undergo a rapid loss of essential differentiated cell properties; we aimed to develop a more physiological in vitro oviduct culture system capable of supporting fertilization. U-shaped chambers were produced using stereo-lithography and mounted with polycarbonate membranes, which were used as culture inserts for primary BOECs. Cells were grown to confluence and cultured at an air-liquid interface for 4 to 6 weeks and subsequently either fixed for immune staining, incubated with sperm cells for live-cell imaging, or used in an oocyte penetration study. Confluent BOEC cultures maintained polarization and differentiation status for at least 6 weeks. When sperm and oocytes were introduced into the system, the BOECs supported oocyte penetration in the absence of artificial sperm capacitation factors while also preventing polyspermy and parthenogenic activation, both of which occur in classical in vitro fertilization systems. Moreover, this ""oviduct-on-a-chip"" allowed live imaging of sperm-oviduct epithelium binding and release.

Due to valvular size, role and location within the body, there is a need for in vitro systems that can recapitulate disease onset and progression. This study combines the development of an in vitro model and its application in the mechanical stimulation of valvular cell transformation. Specifically, porcine aortic valvular interstitial cells (PAVIC) were cultured on polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices with or without exposure to shear stresses. Mechanobiological responses of valvular interstitial cells were evaluated at shear stresses ranging from 0 to 4.26 dyn/cm2. When flow rates were higher than 0.78 dyn/cm2, cells elongated and aligned with the flow direction. In addition, we found that shear stress enhanced the formation of focal adhesions and up-regulated PAVIC transformation, assessed by increased expression of -smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor . This study reveals a link between the action of shear forces, cell phenotype transformation and focal adhesion formation. This constitutes the first step towards the development of co-cultures (interstitial-endothelial cells) on organ-on-a-chip devices, which will enable studies of the signaling pathways regulating force-induced valvular degeneration in microtissues and potential discovery of valvular degeneration therapies.  2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.","10.1007/s10439-017-1871-z",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
13862,"Microcirculation-on-a-chip: A microfluidic platform for assaying blood-and lymphatic-vessel permeability; NA; We developed a microfluidic model of microcirculation containing both blood and lymphatic vessels for examining vascular permeability. The designed microfluidic device harbors upper and lower channels that are partly aligned and are separated by a porous membrane, and on this membrane, blood vascular endothelial cells (BECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were cocultured back-to-back. At cell-cell junctions of both BECs and LECs, claudin-5 and VE-cadherin were detected. The permeability coefficient measured here was lower than the value reported for isolated mammalian venules. Moreover, our results showed that the flow culture established in the device promoted the formation of endothelial cell-cell junctions, and that treatment with histamine, an inflammation-promoting substance, induced changes in the localization of tight and adherens junction-associated proteins and an increase in vascular permeability in the microdevice. These findings indicated that both BECs and LECs appeared to retain their functions in the microfluidic coculture platform. Using this microcirculation device, the vascular damage induced by habu snake venom was successfully assayed, and the assay time was reduced from 24 h to 30 min. This is the first report of a microcirculation model in which BECs and LECs were cocultured.

14651,"New rationale for large metazoan embryo manipulations on chip-based devices; NA; The lack of technologies that combine automated manipulation, sorting, as well as immobilization of single metazoan embryos remains the key obstacle to high-throughput organism-based ecotoxicological analysis and drug screening routines. Noticeably, the major obstacle hampering the automated trapping and arraying of millimetre-sized embryos on chip-based devices is their substantial size and mass, which lead to rapid gravitational-induced sedimentation and strong inertial forces. In this work, we present a comprehensive mechanistic and design rationale for manipulation and passive trapping of individual zebrafish embryos using only hydrodynamic forces. We provide evidence that by employing innovative design features, highly efficient hydrodynamic positioning of large embryos on a chip can be achieved. We also show how computational fluid dynamics-guided design and the Lagrangian particle tracking modeling can be used to optimize the chip performance. Importantly, we show that rapid prototyping and medium scale fabrication of miniaturized devices can be greatly accelerated by combining high-speed laser prototyping with replica moulding in poly(dimethylsiloxane) instead of conventional photolithography techniques. Our work establishes a new paradigm for chip-based manipulation of large multicellular organisms with diameters well above 1 mm and masses often exceeding 1 mg. Passive docking of large embryos is an attractive alternative to provide high level of automation while alleviating potentially deleterious effects associated with the use of active chip actuation.

Therefore, we assessed the toxicity of 3D-printed and molded parts from five different polymers commonly used for prototyping, fabrication of organ-on-a-chip platforms, and medical devices. Toxic effects of PIC100, E-Shell200, E-Shell300, polydimethylsiloxane, and polystyrene (PS) on early bovine embryo development, on the transactivation of estrogen receptors were assessed, and possible polymer-leached components were identified by mass spectrometry. Embryo development beyond the two-cell stage was inhibited by PIC100, E-Shell200, and E-Shell300 and correlated to the released amount of diethyl phthalate and polyethylene glycol. Furthermore, all polymers (except PS) induced estrogen receptor transactivation.

Here, we established a microfluidic-based in vitro model of human bronchial epithelial cells in which cells are stationary, but nutrient supply is dynamic, and we used this system to evaluate cellular uptake of nanoparticles. The cells were maintained in fetal calf serum-free and bovine pituitary extract-free cell culture medium.

For comparison, tests were also performed using static, multi-well cultures. Cellular uptake of the fluorescently labeled particles was investigated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Exposure under dynamic culture conditions resulted in higher cellular uptake of the PS nanoparticles when compared to static conditions, while uptake of SiO(2) nanoparticles was similar in both settings. The present study has shown that it is feasible to grow human lung cells under completely animal-free conditions using a microfluidic-based device, and we have also found that cellular uptake of PS nanoparticles aka nanoplastics is highly dependent on culture conditions.

The recently developed epithelial barrier model of the fish intestine relies on the RTgutGC cell line from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), cultured in inserts on permeable membranes. Our aim was to extend the current system by introducing intestinal fibroblasts as supportive layer in order to reconstruct the epithelial-mesenchymal interface as found in vivo. We therefore initiated and characterized the first fibroblast cell line from the intestine of rainbow trout, which has been termed RTgutF. Co-culture studies of RTgutGC and RTgutF were performed on commercially available electric cell substrate for impedance sensing (ECIS) and on newly developed ultrathin, highly porous alumina membranes to imitate the cellular interaction with the basement membrane. Cellular events were examined with non-invasive impedance spectroscopy to distinguish between barrier tightness and cell density in the ECIS system and to determine transepithelial electrical resistance for cells cultured on the alumina membranes. We highlight the relevance of the piscine intestinal fibroblasts for an advanced intestinal barrier model, particularly on ultrathin alumina membranes. These membranes enable rapid crosstalk of cells cultured on opposite sides, which led to increased barrier tightening in the fish cell line-based epithelial-mesenchymal model.","10.1007/s10616-019-00327-0",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
15109,"Ultrathin Alumina Membranes as Scaffold for Epithelial Cell Culture from the Intestine of Rainbow Trout; anodized aluminum;  cell culture interface;  fish-gut-on-chip;  impedance based toxicity testing;  in vitro epithelial barrier model;  ultrathin membrane; Permeable membranes are indispensable for in vitro epithelial barrier models. However, currently available polymer-based membranes are low in porosity and relatively thick, resulting in a limited permeability and unrealistic culture conditions. In this study, we developed an ultrathin, nanoporous alumina membrane as novel cell culture interface for vertebrate cells, with focus on the rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) intestinal cell line RTgutGC. The new type of membrane is framed in a silicon chip for physical support and has a thickness of only 1 m, with a porosity of 15% and homogeneous nanopores ( = 73  21 nm). Permeability rates for small molecules, namely lucifer yellow, dextran 40, and bovine serum albumin, exceeded those of standard polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes by up to 27 fold. With the final goal to establish a representative model of the fish intestine for environmental toxicology, we engineered a simple culture setup, capable of testing the cellular response toward chemical exposure. Herein, cells were cultured in a monolayer on the alumina membranes and formed a polarized epithelium with apical expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 within 14 days. Impedance spectroscopy, a noninvasive and real time electrical measurement, was used to determine cellular resistance during epithelial layer formation and chemical exposure to evaluate barrier functionality. Resistance values during epithelial development revealed different stages of epithelial maturity and were comparable with the in vivo situation. During chemical exposure, cellular resistance changed immediately when barrier tightness or cell viability was affected. Thus, our study demonstrates nanoporous alumina membranes as promising novel interface for alternative in vitro approaches, capable of allowing cell culture in a physiologically realistic manner and enabling high quality microscopy and sensitive measurement of cellular resistance.  2017 American Chemical Society.","10.1021/acsami.7b00705",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"yes"
15536,"Fabrication of a pumpless, microfluidic skin chip from different collagen sources; Collagen;  ECM;  Microfluidics;  Skin-on-a-chip; Current skin-equivalents do not recapitulate the full functionalities of human skin, and recent efforts have been towards reproduction of 3D architecture of skin, as well as realization of vasculature using microfluidics. These microfluidic skin-on-a-chips use extracellular matrix proteins as a scaffold material for cell culture. Choice of optimal scaffold material is essential for properly recapitulating the tissue microenvironment. Here, we tested collagens from different sources, rat tail, porcine skin, and duck feet, comparing their abilities to support cell growth and differentiation. The viability was compared, and immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate differentiation of the skin constructs using different scaffold materials. The collagens from different sources had distinct mechanical properties, as well as the degree of contraction upon fibroblast culture. The morphology of skin tissue and the microstructure of the construct were also different, depending on the collagen sources and culture conditions. Our study provides valuable information about the choice of scaffold materials for constructing a 3D skin model.  2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","10.1016/j.jiec.2017.07.034",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
15729,"Bioinspired Soft Robotic Caterpillar with Cardiomyocyte Drivers; cardiomyocytes;  drug screening;  microfluidics;  soft robots;  structural colors; Biological soft robots have attracted extensive attention and research because of their superiority in executing designed biomedical missions compared with conventional robots. Here, inspired by the crawling mechanism of snakes and caterpillars, a novel biological soft robot composed of asymmetric claws, a carbon nanotube (CNT)-induced myocardial tissue layer, and a structural color indicator is presented. The asymmetric claws can assist the whole soft robot to accomplish directional movement during the cardiomyocytes' contraction process. The oriented conduct of the CNT layer can regulate the cardiomyocytes' arrangement and improve their beating capability and the contraction performance. However, the structural color indicator provides a visualized monitoring approach to dynamically and immediately reflect the motion status of the biological soft robots. With these three functional layers, the cardiomyocyte-driven soft robot can greatly simulate the crawling behavior of a caterpillar. It is demonstrated that by integrating these soft robots in a microfluidic organ-on-a-chip system with multitrack construction, they can run along the tracks and exhibit different running speed based on the stimulus concentrations in the tracks. These features indicate the potential values of the cardiomyocyte-driven soft robots for providing an effective screening platform for clinical diseases.  2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

15867,"Comparison Between Franz Diffusion Cell and a novel Micro-physiological System for In Vitro Penetration Assay Using Different Skin Models.; Drug delivery and caffeine penetration and in vitro diffusion system and skin model; In vitro diffusive models are an important tool to screen the penetration ability of active ingredients in various formulations. A reliable assessment of skin penetration enhancing properties, mechanism of action of carrier systems, and an estimation of a bioavailability are essential for transdermal delivery. Given the importance of testing the penetration kinetics of different compounds across the skin barrier, several in vitro models have been developedThe aim of this study was to compare the Franz Diffusion Cell (FDC) with a novel fluid-dynamic platform (MIVO) by evaluating penetration ability of caffeine, a widely used reference substance, and LIP1, a testing molecule having the same molecular weight but a different lipophilicity in the two diffusion chamber systems. A 0.7% caffeine or LIP1 formulation in either water or propylene glycol (PG) containing oleic acid (OA) was topically applied on the Strat-M membrane or pig ear skin, according to the infinite-dose experimental condition (780 ul/cm(2)). The profile of the penetration kinetics was determined by quantify the amount of molecule absorbed at different time-points (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours), by means of HPLC analysis. Both diffusive systems show a similar trend for caffeine and LIP1 penetration kinetics. The Strat-M skin model shows a lower barrier function than the pig skin biopsies, whereby the PGOA vehicle exhibits a higher penetration, enhancing the effect for both diffusive chambers and skin surrogates. Most interestingly, MIVO diffusive system better predicts the lipophilic molecules (i.e. LIP1) permeation through highly physiological fluid flows resembled below the skin models.","10.1016/j.slast.2021.12.006",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
15871,"Intestinal explant barrier chip: long-term intestinal absorption screening in a novel microphysiological system using tissue explants.; NA; The majority of intestinal in vitro screening models use cell lines that do not reflect the complexity of the human intestinal tract and hence often fail to accurately predict intestinal drug absorption. Tissue explants have intact intestinal architecture and cell type diversity, but show short viability in static conditions. Here, we present a medium throughput microphysiological system, Intestinal Explant Barrier Chip (IEBC), that creates a dynamic microfluidic microenvironment and prolongs tissue viability. Using a snap fit mechanism, we successfully incorporated human and porcine colon tissue explants and studied tissue functionality, integrity and viability for 24 hours. With a proper distinction of transcellular over paracellular transport (ratio >2), tissue functionality was good at early and late timepoints. Low leakage of FITC-dextran and preserved intracellular lactate dehydrogenase levels indicate maintained tissue integrity and viability, respectively. From a selection of low to high permeability drugs, 6 out of 7 properly ranked according to their fraction absorbed. In conclusion, the IEBC is a novel screening platform benefitting from the complexity of tissue explants and the flow in microfluidic chips.","10.1039/d1lc00669j",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"
16103,"Establishment of a resazurin-based aortic valve tissue viability assay for dynamic culture in a microphysiological system.; Aortic valve stenosis and dynamic tissue culture and human aortic valve and microphysiological system and resazurin reduction and tissue viability; BACKGROUND/AIM: Tissue pathogenesis of aortic valve (AV) stenosis is research focus in cardiac surgery. Model limitations of conventional 2D culture of human or porcine valvular interstitial/endothelial cells (VIC/VECs) isolated from aortic valve tissues but also limited ability of (small) animal models to reflect human (patho)physiological situation in AV position raise the need to establish an in vitro setup using AV tissues. Resulting aim is to approximate (patho)physiological conditions in a dynamic pulsatile Microphysiological System (MPS) to culture human and porcine AV tissue with preservation of tissue viability but also defined ECM composition. MATERIALS/METHODS: A tissue incubation chamber (TIC) was designed to implement human or porcine tissues (35mm2) in a dynamic pulsatile culture in conventional cell culture ambience in a MPS. Cell viability assays based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-release or resazurin-conversion were tested for applicability in the system and applied for a culture period of 14 days with interval evaluation of tissue viability on every other day. Resazurin-assay setup was compared in static vs. dynamic culture using varying substance saturation settings (50-300M), incubation times and tissue masses and was consequently adapted. RESULTS: Sterile dynamic culture of human and porcine AV tissue segments was established at a pulsatile flow rate range of 0.9-13.4l/s. Implementation of tissues was realized by stitching the material in a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-ring and insertion in the TIC-MPS-system. Culture volume of 2ml caused LDH dilution not detectable in standard membrane integrity assay setup. Therefore, detection of resazurin-conversion of viable tissue was investigated. Optimal incubation time for viability conversion was determined at two hours at a saturated concentration of 300M resazurin. Measurement in static conditions was shown to offer comparable results as dynamic condition but allowing optimal handling and TIC sterilization protocols for long term culture. Preliminary results revealed favourable porcine AV tissue viability over a 14 day period confirmed via resazurin-assay comparing statically cultured tissue counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Human and porcine AV tissue can be dynamically cultured in a TIC-MPS with monitoring of tissue viability using an adapted resazurin-assay setup. Preliminary results reveal advantageous viability of porcine AV tissues after dynamic TIC-MPS culture compared to static control.","10.3233/ch-219112",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"yes"

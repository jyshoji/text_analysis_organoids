Clement C and Birindelli G and Pizzichemi M and Pagano F and Kruithof-De Julio M and Ziegler S and Rominger A and Auffray E and Shi K,Concept development of an on-chip PET system.,EJNMMI physics,"BACKGROUND: Organs-on-Chips (OOCs), microdevices mimicking in vivo organs, find growing applications in disease modeling and drug discovery. With the increasing number of uses comes a strong demand for imaging capabilities of OOCs as monitoring physiologic processes within OOCs is vital for the continuous improvement of this technology. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) would be ideal for OOC imaging, however, current PET systems are insufficient for this task due to their inadequate spatial resolution. In this work, we propose the concept of an On-Chip PET system capable of imaging OOCs and optimize its design using a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed system consists of four detectors arranged around the OOC device. Each detector is made of two monolithic LYSO crystals and covered with Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) on multiple surfaces. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with data from a MCS to predict the first gamma-ray interaction position inside the detector from the light patterns that are recorded by the SiPMs on the detector's surfaces. RESULTS: The CNN achieves a mean average prediction error of 0.80 mm in the best configuration. The proposed system achieves a sensitivity of 34.81% for 13 mm thick crystals and does not show a prediction degradation near the boundaries of the detector. We use the trained network to reconstruct an image of a grid of 21 point sources spread across the field-of-view and obtain a mean spatial resolution of 0.55 mm. We show that 25,000 Line of Responses (LORs) are needed to reconstruct a realistic OOC phantom with adequate image quality. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a spatial resolution of almost 0.5 mm in a PET system made of multiple monolithic LYSO crystals by directly predicting the scintillation position from light patterns created with SiPMs. We observe that a thinner crystal performs better than a thicker one, that increasing the SiPM size from 3 mm to 6 mm only slightly decreases the prediction performance, and that certain surfaces encode significantly more information for the scintillation-point prediction than others.",10.1186/s40658-022-00467-x,12860,PubMed,k

Lack of experimental human models for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a major obstacle that hinders the development of treatment strategies. Here, we model the Ebola hemorrhagic syndrome in a microvessel-on-a-chip system and demonstrate its applicability to drug studies. Luminal infusion of Ebola virus-like particles leads to albumin leakage from the engineered vessels. The process is mediated by the Rho/ROCK pathway and is associated with cytoskeleton remodeling. Infusion of Ebola glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) generates a similar phenotype, indicating the key role of GP(1,2) in this process.

A planar, self-renewing human intestinal monolayer platform based on primary adult gastrointestinal stem cells, termed the 2D crypt model, has been developed to screen for the effects of various compounds on the intestinal epithelium. The 2D crypt platform is based on a standard 12-well plate format and consists of cell culture inserts with a collagen film overlaying an impermeable film patterned with an array of micron-scale holes. This two-chamber format enables a gradient of growth factors to be applied such that the tissue self-organizes into spatially segregated stem and differentiated cell compartments. The patterned monolayer mimics a gut epithelium in possessing a stem cell niche, migrating proliferative and differentiated cells. Once established, the 2D crypts replicate many aspects of in vivo physiology, including cell migration, maturation, and apoptotic cell death. The planar geometry of the system simplifies dosing, sampling, and imaging during assay. An immunofluorescence-based assay was established to quantitatively assess cell density, proliferation, migration, viability, and the abundance and localization of postmitotic lineages as a function of time. The model was used to perform a small-scale screen of compounds, including signaling molecules, endogenous hormones/cytokines, and microbial metabolites, on tissue homeostasis. Hit compounds that significantly impacted proliferation and/or differentiation were readily identified.

Part I: Macroscale modeling approach & validation,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,"The dynamic nature of in vitro drug metabolism models demands reliable numerical tools to determine key design parameter values towards high-fidelity cell-based platforms of in vivo drug metabolism. This paper represents the first of a two-part model-based investigation of a 3D dynamic microorgan device (DMD). The prescribed tissue model in this paper is precisely embedded within a DMD by 3D bioprinting hydrogel encapsulated liver cells into a patterned array of microchannels. A perfusing drug substrate is biotransformed by liver cells encapsulated within porous hydrogel walls. Therefore, the free and porous flow regime equations are first solved in tandem to derive the laminar velocity profile and wall shear stresses in the entire shear-mediated flow regime. These equations are then coupled with a convection-diffusion equation and Michaelis-Menten reaction terms, resulting in an effective convection-diffusion-cell kinetics model. A key consideration addressed herein is mechanotransduction where shear stresses on the encapsulated cells alter subcellular liver enzyme reaction rates. Cells are incorporated into the geometric model implicitly (macroscale) as enzyme reaction structures uniformly distributed throughout the DMD length. Transient simulations enable effluent drug metabolite profile determination wherein the proposed macroscale modeling approach is validated with an experimental drug flow study.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/bit.25822,14661,Scopus,u

Part II: Microscale modeling approach and validation,Biotechnology and Bioengineering,"The authors have previously reported a rigorous macroscale modeling approach for an in vitro 3D dynamic microorgan device (DMD). This paper represents the second of a two-part model-based investigation where the effect of microscale (single liver cell-level) shear-mediated mechanotransduction on drug biotransformation is deconstructed. Herein, each cell is explicitly incorporated into the geometric model as single compartmentalized metabolic structures. Each cell's metabolic activity is coupled with the microscale hydrodynamic Wall Shear Stress (WSS) simulated around the cell boundary through a semi-empirical polynomial function as an additional reaction term in the mass transfer equations. Guided by the macroscale model-based hydrodynamics, only 9 cells in 3 representative DMD domains are explicitly modeled. Dynamic and reaction similarity rules based on non-dimensionalization are invoked to correlate the numerical and empirical models, accounting for the substrate time scales. The proposed modeling approach addresses the key challenge of computational cost towards modeling complex large-scale DMD-type system with prohibitively high cell densities. Transient simulations are implemented to extract the drug metabolite profile with the microscale modeling approach validated with an experimental drug flow study. The results from the author's study demonstrate the preferred implementation of the microscale modeling approach over that of its macroscale counterpart. Biotechnol.

Maschmeyer I and Kakava S,Organ-on-a-Chip.,Advances in biochemical engineering/biotechnology,"Limitations of the current tools used in the drug development process, cell cultures, and animal models have highlighted the need for a new powerful tool that can emulate the human physiology in vitro. Advances in the field of microfluidics have made the realization of this tool closer than ever. Organ-on-a-chip platforms have been the first step forward, leading to the combination and integration of multiple organ models in the same platform with human-on-a-chip being the ultimate goal. Despite the current progress and technological developments, there are still several unmet engineering and biological challenges curtailing their development and widespread application in the biomedical field. The potentials, challenges, and current work on this unprecedented tool are being discussed in this chapter.",10.1007/10_2020_135,12772,PubMed,u
Park SE and Georgescu A and Huh D,Organoids-on-a-chip.,"Science (New York, N.Y.)","Recent studies have demonstrated an array of stem cell-derived, self-organizing miniature organs, termed organoids, that replicate the key structural and functional characteristics of their in vivo counterparts. As organoid technology opens up new frontiers of research in biomedicine, there is an emerging need for innovative engineering approaches for the production, control, and analysis of organoids and their microenvironment. In this Review, we explore organ-on-a-chip technology as a platform to fulfill this need and examine how this technology may be leveraged to address major technical challenges in organoid research. We also discuss emerging opportunities and future obstacles for the development and application of organoid-on-a-chip technology.",10.1126/science.aaw7894,14387,PubMed,u
Low LA and Sutherland M and Lumelsky N and Selimovic S and Lundberg MS and Tagle DA,Organs-on-a-Chip.,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Organs-on-chips, also known as ""tissue chips"" or microphysiological systems (MPS), are bioengineered microsystems capable of recreating aspects of human organ physiology and function and are in vitro tools with multiple applications in drug discovery and development. The ability to recapitulate human and animal tissues in physiologically relevant three-dimensional, multi-cellular environments allows applications in the drug development field, including; (1) use in assessing the safety and toxicity testing of potential therapeutics during early-stage preclinical drug development; (2) confirmation of drug/therapeutic efficacy in vitro; and (3) disease modeling of human tissues to recapitulate pathophysiology within specific subpopulations and even individuals, thereby advancing precision medicine efforts. This chapter will discuss the development and evolution of three-dimensional organ models over the past decade, and some of the opportunities offered by MPS technology that are not available through current standard two-dimensional cell cultures, or three-dimensional organoid systems. This chapter will outline future avenues of research in the MPS field, how cutting-edge biotechnology advances are expanding the applications for these systems, and discuss the current and future potential and challenges remaining for the field to address.",10.1007/978-3-030-36588-2_3,15392,PubMed,u
Sahu S.C. and Hayes A.W.,Risk assessment of chemical mixtures,Int. J. Clin. Exp. Med,"Humans are exposed daily to numerous mixtures of chemicals present in their environment instead of just a single chemical. The classical health risk assessment for regulatory decisions uses the chemical toxicity of a single test agent one at a time. Comparison of the toxicity of even a simple chemical mixture with that of its parts often shows significant differences. Therefore, the classical chemical risk assessment paradigm does not represent real-world human exposure, making a risk assessment of chemical mixtures an even more complex process. In vitro, in silico, organs-on-a-chip, and 3D cell culture models are examples of alternative approaches that have been used for toxicity screening. The developing genomic and epigenomic technologies also show promise for human health risk assessment. However, all these execting experimental models and tools must be validated before they can be used to support hazard and risk assessments of chemical mixtures for regulatory approval.",NA,30322,EMBASE,k

The currently available and common research models for EOC include tumor cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. However, these models have certain shortcomings: establishing a cell line is time-consuming, loss of genetic traits after long-term culture is a possibility, and investment is required in terms of animal care facilities. Therefore, better research models are required. Organoid technology was originally developed from colorectal cancer. Tumor organoid is a three-dimensional culture system and can help accurately recapture the tumor phenotype from the original tumor. Tumor organoid systems can overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings of the currently available research models. The organoid model can be used for culturing ovarian cancer subtypes, screening drugs, assessing genomes, and establishing biobanks. However, the currently available organoid models can only culture one type of cells, epithelial cells. Therefore, an organoid-on-a-chip device can be developed in the future to provide a microenvironment for cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-media interactions. Thus, organoid models can be used in ovarian cancer research and can generate a simulated in vivo system, enabling studies on the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer.",10.4103/tcmj.tcmj\_63\_21,31197,Web of Science,r

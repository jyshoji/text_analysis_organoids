The failure to demonstrate drug efficacy has been the major reason that drug development does not progress beyond phase II and III clinical trials. The combination of two-dimensional (2D) cellular in vitro and animal models has been the gold standard for basic science research and preclinical drug development studies. However, most findings from these systems fail to translate into human trials because these models only partly recapitulate human physiology and pathology. The lack of a dynamic three-dimensional microenvironment in 2D cellular models reduces the physiological relevance, and for these reasons, 3D and microfluidic model systems are now being developed as more native-like biological assay platforms. 3D cellular in vitro systems, microfluidics, self-organized organoids, and 3D biofabrication are the most promising technologies to mimic human physiology because they provide mechanical cues and a 3D microenvironment to the multicellular components. With the advent of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, the 3D dynamic in vitro systems further enable extensive access to human-like tissue models. As increasingly complex 3D cellular systems are produced, the use of current visualization technologies is limited due to the thickness and opaqueness of 3D tissues. Tissue-clearing techniques improve light penetration deep into tissues by matching refractive indices among the 3D components. 3D segmentation enables quantitative measurements based on 3D tissue images.

However, one limitation has been organization of differentiated cells into multi-cellular, three-dimensional assemblies. The islets of Langerhans contain many endocrine and non-endocrine cell types, such as insulin-producing beta cells and endothelial cells. Despite the potential importance of endothelial cells to islet function, facilitating interactions between endothelial cells and islet endocrine cell types already differentiated from human embryonic stem cells has been difficult in vitro. We have developed a strategy of assembling human embryonic stem cell-derived islet cells with endothelial cells into three-dimensional aggregates on a hydrogel. The resulting islet organoids express beta cell and other endocrine markers and are functional, capable of undergoing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This assembly was not observed on traditional tissue culture plastic and in aggregates generated in suspension culture, highlighting how physical culture conditions greatly influence the interactions among these cell types.

One possible approach for reconstructing human organs in vitro is to generate cell sheets of a specific pattern and later stack them systematically by layer into a three-dimensional organoid. However, many commonly used cell patterning techniques suffer drawbacks such as dependence on sophisticated instruments and manipulation of cells under suboptimal growth conditions. Here, we describe a simple cell patterning method that may overcome these problems. This method is based on magnetic force and photoresponsive poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) hydrogels. The PEG-DA hydrogel was magnetized by mixing with iron ferrous microparticles and then fabricated into blocks with a specific pattern by photolithography. The resolution of the hydrogel empty space pattern was approximately 150 mum and the generated hydrogel blocks can be remotely manipulated with a magnet. The magnetic PEG-DA blocks were used as a stencil to define the area for cell adhesion in the cell culture dish, and the second types of cells could be seeded after the magnetic block was removed to create heterotypic cell patterns. Cell viability assay has demonstrated that magnetic PEG-DA and the patterning process produced negligible effects on cell growth. Together, our results indicate that this magnetic hydrogel-based cell patterning method is simple to perform and is a useful tool for tissue surrogate assembly for disease mechanism study and drug screening.",NA,8097,"EMBASE","k"

Instead of humans and other living things, biohybrid robots can be used in various fields such as drug screening and toxicity assessment. In the actuation part, however, since a muscle cell-based biohybrid robot is limited in that the driving force is weak, it is difficult to evaluate drug and toxicological effects by distinguishing changes in the biohybrid robot's motion. To overcome this limitation, we introduced hyaluronic acid-modified gold nanoparticles (HA-AuNPs) into a muscle bundle-based biohybrid robot that moves forward in response to electrical stimulation. To enhance the actuation of muscle bundles, HA-AuNPs were embedded into the muscle bundles. The motion of the fabricated biohybrid robot was improved due to the enhanced differentiation and the improved electrical conductivity of muscle bundles by HA-AuNPs. In addition, the fabricated biohybrid robot exhibited huge changes in motion with respect to the addition of positive and negative inotropic drugs.

Here, we investigated the role of autophagy in murine esophageal epithelial cells (keratinocytes) exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde.

Stem cells derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) attenuated liver injury upon transplantation in animal models for liver fibrosis. However, only a small portion of the transplanted cells propagated in the recipient liver. Aim(s): We hypothesized that the efficiency of cell therapy could be improved by transplanting amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) derived HLCs along with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and undifferentiated AMSCs. Method(s): Briefly, we used a two-step protocol to generate induced HLCs. We confirmed organoids formation of HLCs in 3D collagen scaffolds with HUVECs and AMSCs. To determine whether the HLCs can migrate into the liver tissue and perform in vivo function, we transplanted the cells to mice with liver fibrosis. Result(s): Co-culture of HLCs with HUVECs and AMSCs demonstrated improved function of HLCs within the organoids. Furthermore, transplantation using non-homogeneous cells, i.e. HLCs mixed with HUVECs and AMSCs, exhibited better graft survival in the host animals with liver fibrosis. Our experiment results suggested that compared to mock transplantation or HLCs transplantation groups, liver fibrosis was reduced significantly in mixed-cell groups. The AST levels in the plasma of transplanted mice were markedly decreased only in the mixed-cell transplantation group.

Pathogenic bacteria produce amyloid-like proteins ""curli"" that form biofilms and show functional similarities to human amyloid- (A). These proteins may contribute to neurological disease progression via signaling cascade from the gut to the brain. OBJECTIVE: We propose that curli causes neuroendocrine activation from the gut to brain that promotes central A pathology. METHODS: PGP9.5 and TLR2 levels in response to curli in the lumen of Tg2576 AD mice were analyzed by immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR analysis. Western blot and human 3D in vitro enteroids culture systems were also used. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate bacterial dysbiosis. RESULTS: We found significant increase in bacterial-amyloid curli with elevated TLR2 at the mRNA level in the pre- and symptomatic Tg-AD gut compared to littermate WT controls. This data associates with increased gram-positive bacterial colonization in the ileum of the symptomatic AD mice. We found fundamental evidence for vagus nerve activation in response to bacterial curli. Neuroendocrine marker PGP9.5 was significantly elevated in the gut epithelium of symptomatic AD mice, and this was colocalized with increased TLR2 expression. Enteroids, 3D-human ileal mini-gut monolayer in vitro model system also revealed increase levels of TLR2 upon stimulation with purified bacterial curli fibrils. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the importance of pathological changes within the gut-vagus-brain signaling in response to luminal bacterial amyloid that might play a vital role in central A pathogenesis seen in the AD brain.","10.3233/jad-220106",15261,"PubMed","k"

The amelanotic circumpapillary mass extended superonasally in a geographic configuration and measured 14x12 mm. There was no subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, feeder vessels, or tumor seeding. Ocular ultrasonography confirmed a homogeneous calcified intraocular mass 3.1 mm in thickness. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography revealed that the lesion was located within the sclera compressing the overlying choroidal tissue. Further evaluation disclosed cutaneous aplasia cutis congenita with nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed an arachnoid cyst of the brain. Later, optical coherence tomography revealed the mass to be in the deep choroid or within the sclera. This constellation of ocular, cutaneous, and neurological features were suggestive of organoid nevus syndrome. At the 2-year follow-up, the findings were stable. The calcified choristoma of organoid nevus syndrome, located within the sclera in this case, has distinctive clinical features that differentiate this benign tumor from retinoblastoma.

J","Background: Chronic lung diseases, especially emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, are the third leading cause of mortality worldwide. Their treatment includes symptom alleviation, slowing of the disease progression, and ultimately organ transplant. Regenerative medicine represents an attractive alternative. Objective(s): To develop a dual approach to lung therapy by engineering a platform dedicated to both remodeling pulmonary architecture (bronchoscopic lung volume reduction) and regeneration of lost respiratory tissue (scaffold). Method(s): The authors developed a hydrogel scaffold based on the natural polymers gelatin and alginate. The unique physical properties allow its injection through long catheters that pass through the working channel of a bronchoscope. The scaffold might reach the diseased area; thus, serving a dual purpose: remodeling the lung architecture as a lung volume reduction material and developing a platform for tissue regeneration to allow for cell or organoid implant. Result(s): The authors' novel hydrogel scaffold can be injected through long catheters, exhibiting the physical and mechanical properties necessary for the dual treatment objectives. Its bio-compatibility was analyzed on human fibroblasts and mouse mesenchymal cells. Cells injected with the scaffold through long narrow catheters exhibited at least 70% viability up to 7 days. Conclusion(s): The catheter-injectable gelatin-alginate hydrogel represents a new concept, which combines tissue engineering with minimal invasive procedure.

This interaction initiates a proinflammatory response that antagonizes pig performance and increases morbidity and mortality. Understanding this signaling cascade in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs has relied heavily on cell lines isolated several decades ago. Therefore, we produced and characterized a porcine intestinal enteriod model to study the impact a LPS challenge has on TLR4 localization. Modifying protocols used to isolate porcine, murine, and human intestinal epithelial stem cells (IESC), we were able to isolate porcine IESC. After 7 to 10 d of culturing the IESC, 3-dimensional intestinal enteroid structures were identified. These intestinal enteroids were characterized via immunofluorescent markers (villin, chromogranin A, and claudin 4) and were shown to contain enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells and form tight junctions. After 14 to 16 d of culture, porcine intestinal enteroids underwent a 24-h LPS challenge (10 g/mL) to study the localization of TLR4. Control intestinal enteroids showed TLR4 disbursed throughout the cells, whereas localization was more punctate in LPS-treated intestinal enteroids. Co-staining with the early endosome marker early endosome antigen 1 showed increased internalization and colocalization of TLR4 with early endosome antigen 1 after LPS exposure (P = 0.03). In conclusion, porcine intestinal enteroids were responsive to a LPS challenge, which resulted in the internalization of TLR4 to the early endosome, and these enteroids cultures may be a viable model for understanding intestinal inflammation and receptor localization.  2016 American Society of Animal Science.

Stem Cells","BACKGROUND Liver organoids have recently been applied as models for liver disease and drug screening, especially when combined with liver-on-a-chip technologies. Compared to hepatocyte-like cells, primary hepatocytes have high functionality but cannot maintain their function when cultured in vitro. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhance hepatocyte function and maintain hepatocyte metabolism when co-cultured with hepatocytes. MSCs can help induced pluripotent stem cells to generate an organoid structure via the MSC-based traction force triggered by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, primary hepatocytes were co-cultured with MSCs on a liver-derived ECM to generate liver organoids within a short duration. AIM To create hepatocyte organoids by co-culturing primary hepatocytes with MSCs on a porcine liver extracellular matrix (PLECM) gel. METHODS Perfusion and enzymatic hydrolysis were used to form the PLECM gel. Rat hepatocytes and human MSCs were mixed and plated on pre-solidified PLECM gel in a 48-well plate for 48 h to generate organoids. Generated organoids were evaluated through hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, immuno-histological, and immunofluorescence staining, and quantitative PCR for alb, CYP450 gene markers, and urea cycle genes. Culture medium was collected to detect albumin (ALB) and urea production on days 2,4, 6,8,14, and 20. RESULTS The whole porcine liver was perfused and enzymatically hydrolyzed to form a PLECM gel. The structural components and basement membrane composition of the ECM, such as collagen type I, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin, were demonstrated to be retained. Through interaction of human MSCs with the liver-derived ECM, primary hepatocytes and human MSCs assembled together into a 3D construction and generated primary hepatocyte organoids for 48 h. The mRNAs of the gene alb, the CYP450 gene markers cyp1a1, cyp1a2, and cyp3a2 as well as urea cycle genes arg-1, asl, ass-1, cps-1, nags were highly expressed in hepatocyte organoids. Long-term survival of the primary hepatocyte organoids, as well as stable functionality, was demonstrated via ALB and urea production in vitro. CONCLUSION Our new method of creating primary hepatocyte organoids by co-culturing hepatocytes with MSCs on liver-derived ECM hydrogels could be used to develop models for liver disease and for drug screening.Copyright The Author(s) 2020.

J. Artif. Organs","Introduction: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), known for their high immune modulatory capacity are promising tools for several cell-based therapies. To better mimic the in vivo situation of MSC interactions with immune cells, we applied an artificial lymph node (ALN)-bioreactor culture system combining a miniaturized perfusion bioreactor with a 3D matrix-based cell culture of immune competent cells forming micro-organoids. Method(s): Rat lymph node cells and allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs were seeded in a 20:1 ratio within the agarose matrix of the ALN-reactor. Lymphocytes were pre-incubated with Concanavalin A (ConA) and then co-cultured with MSC in the matrix with additional ConA in the perfusing medium. Live/dead staining showed survival of the co-cultures during the 8-day ALN-reactor run. Paraffin sections of bioreactor matrices were analyzed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-specific staining to determine MSC proliferation. Immune modulatory capacity was defined by daily analysis of cytokine secretion profiles (TNFalpha, TNFgamma, IL-1alpha, IL-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40/p70, GM-CSF). Result(s): Cytokine peak secretion at day 2 was significantly inhibited by MSCs for TNFalpha (96.8 +/- 4.8%) and TNFgamma (88.7 +/- 12.0%) in 3D co-cultures. In contrast, other cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-12) were induced. Furthermore, we detected a significantly higher (58.8%) fraction of proliferating MSCs in the presence of immune cells compared to control bioreactors loaded with MSCs only.

This chapter focuses on the physico-chemical and genetic cues utilized to engineer the stem cell niche and provides an overview on how both bioprinting and microfluidics technologies are improving our knowledge in this field for both disease modeling and tissue regeneration, including drug discovery and toxicity high-throughput assays and stem cell-based therapies in humans.","10.1007/978-3-319-69194-7_13",22392,"PubMed","k"

Proper exploitation of these methods may lead to personalized organ transplants, but to regenerate organs, it is necessary to develop methods for assembling differentiated cells into functional, organ-level tissues. The generation of three-dimensional human tissue models also holds potential for medical advances in disease modeling, as full organ functionality may not be necessary to recapitulate disease pathophysiology. This is specifically true of lung diseases where animal models often do not recapitulate human disease. Here, we present a method for the generation of self-assembled human lung tissue and its potential for disease modeling and drug discovery for lung diseases characterized by progressive and irreversible scarring such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Tissue formation occurs because of the overlapping processes of cellular adhesion to multiple alveolar sac templates, bioreactor rotation, and cellular contraction. Addition of transforming growth factor-1 to single cell-type mesenchymal organoids resulted in morphologic scarring typical of that seen in IPF but not in two-dimensional IPF fibroblast cultures. Furthermore, this lung organoid may be modified to contain multiple lung cell types assembled into the correct anatomical location, thereby allowing cell-cell contact and recapitulating the lung microenvironment. Our bottom-up approach for synthesizing patient-specific lung tissue in a scalable system allows for the development of relevant human lung disease models with the potential for high throughput drug screening to identify targeted therapies.

Through the differentiation of these cells as retinal organoids, it is now possible to model the spatial and temporal development of the human retina using hPSCs, in which retinal progenitor cells produce the entire repertoire of retinal cells, first differentiating into retinal ganglion cells and ending with mature photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Mller glia. Importantly, retinal organoids self-assemble into laminated structures that recapitulate the layering of the human retina with a retinal ganglion cell layer lining the inner layer and a distinctly separate photoreceptor layer occupying the outer layers. This organoid technology has provided access to human tissue for developmental and disease modeling, as well as translational applications such as high throughput drug screening and cell replacement therapies.

The findings implicate cortical actin tension-mediated filamin unfolding in ER function and underscore the importance of tissue mechanics in organoid homeostasis.","10.15252/embj.2021109205",14065,"PubMed","k"

Microbiol","Toxin-producing strains of Clostridioides difficile and Clostridium perfringens cause infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans and ruminants, with the toxins being major virulence factors, essential for the infection, and responsible for the onset of severe symptoms. C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), and the large cytotoxin (TpeL) from C. perfringens are single chain bacterial protein toxins with an AB-like toxin structure. The C-terminal delivery domain mediates cell entry of the N-terminal glycosyltransferase domain by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several cell surface proteins have been proposed to serve as toxin receptors, including chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), poliovirus receptor-like 3 (PVRL3), and frizzled-1/2/7 (FZD1/2/7) for TcdB and LDL-receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) for TpeL. The expression of the TcdB receptors was investigated in human intestinal organoids (HIOs) and in cultured cell lines. HIOs from four human donors exhibited a comparable profile of receptor expression, with PVRL3, LRP1, and FZD7 being expressed and CSPG4 and FZD2 not being expressed. In human epithelial Caco-2 cells and HT29 cells as well as in immortalized murine fibroblasts, either receptor FZD2/7, CSPG4, PVRL3, and LRP1 was expressed. The question whether the toxins take advantage of the normal turnover of their receptors (i.e., constitutive endocytosis and recycling) from the cell surface or whether the toxins activity induce the internalization of their receptors has not yet been addressed. For the analysis of receptor internalization, temperature-induced uptake of biotinylated toxin receptors into immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Caco-2 cells was exploited. Solely LRP1 exhibited constitutive endocytosis from the plasma membrane to the endosome, which might be abused by TpeL (and possibly TcdB as well) for cell entry. Furthermore, internalization of CSPG4, PVRL3, FZD2, and FZD7 was observed neither in MEFs nor in Caco-2 cells. FZD2/7, CSPG4, and PVRL3 did thus exhibit no constitutive recycling. The presence of TcdB and the p38 activation induced by anisomycin were not able to induce or enhance CSPG4 or PVRL3 uptake in MEFs.

As a result, in vitro approaches to model human brain development and disease are an intense area of research. Here we describe a recently established protocol for generating 3D brain tissue, so-called cerebral organoids, which closely mimics the endogenous developmental program. This method can easily be implemented in a standard tissue culture room and can give rise to developing cerebral cortex, ventral telencephalon, choroid plexus and retinal identities, among others, within 1-2 months. This straightforward protocol can be applied to developmental studies, as well as to the study of a variety of human brain diseases. Furthermore, as organoids can be maintained for more than 1 year in long-term culture, they also have the potential to model later events such as neuronal maturation and survival.","10.1038/nprot.2014.158",15074,"PubMed","u"

This allows high-definition imaging but poorly reflects the host tissue's physiological architecture and may result in artifacts. We developed a method for live-cell imaging of microbial infection dynamics on human adult stem cell-derived intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layers.

Breast cancer cells with CD44(+)CD24(-) phenotype are cultured in three-dimensional (3D) stereotype showing the recapitulation of tumors in vivo such as cell differentiation, heterogeneity, and microenvironment. Using this 3D model in anti-cancer compound research results in a more accurate reflection than conventional monolayer cell culture. This study aimed to identify the antitumor activity of Hopea odorata methanol extract (HO-MeOH-E) on breast cancer cells and cancer stem-like cells in both models of three-dimensional culture (3D) and monolayer cell culture (2D). Methods HO-MeOH-E was produced from Hopea odorata plant. The VN9 breast cancer cells (VN9) were collected and expanded from the previous study. The breast cancer stem-like cells (VN9CSC) were sorted from the VN9 based on phenotype CD44(+)CD24(-). Both VN9 and VN9CSC were used to culture in monolayer culture (2D) and organoids (3D) before they were used to treat with HO-MeOH-E.

Breast cancer cells with CD44(+)CD24(-) phenotype are cultured in three-dimensional (3D) stereotype showing the recapitulation of tumors in vivo such as cell differentiation, heterogeneity, and microenvironment. Using this 3D model in anti-cancer compound research results in a more accurate reflection than conventional monolayer cell culture. This study aimed to identify the antitumor activity of Hopea odorata methanol extract (HO-MeOH-E) on breast cancer cells and cancer stem-like cells in both models of three-dimensional culture (3D) and monolayer cell culture (2D). METHODS: HO-MeOH-E was produced from Hopea odorata plant. The VN9 breast cancer cells (VN9) were collected and expanded from the previous study. The breast cancer stem-like cells (VN9CSC) were sorted from the VN9 based on phenotype CD44(+)CD24(-). Both VN9 and VN9CSC were used to culture in monolayer culture (2D) and organoids (3D) before they were used to treat with HO-MeOH-E. Two other anticancer drugs, doxorubicin and tirapazamine, were used as references. The antitumor activities of extracts and drugs were determined via two assays: antiproliferation using the Alamar blue assay and cell cycle assay. RESULTS: The results showed that HO-MeOH-E was sensitive to both VN9 and VN9CSC in 3D more than 2D culture (IC(50) on 3D organoids 144.8  2.172 g/mL and on 2D 340.2  17.01 g/mL for VN9CSC (p < 0.001); IC(50) on 3D organoids 2055  82.2 g/mL and on 2D 430.6  8.612 g/mL for VN9 (p < 0.0001), respectively).

"Rhodes, Katherine and Barr, Kenneth A. and Popp, Joshua M. and Strober, Benjamin J. and Battle, Alexis and Gilad, Yoav","Human embryoid bodies as a novel system for genomic studies of functionally diverse cell types","ELIFE","Practically all studies of gene expression in humans to date have been performed in a relatively small number of adult tissues. Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types. eLife digest One major goal of human genetics is to understand how changes in the way genes are regulated affect human traits, including disease susceptibility. To date, most studies of gene regulation have been performed in adult tissues, such as liver or kidney tissue, that were collected at a single time point. Yet, gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent, meaning that it is important to gather data from a greater variety of cell types at different stages of their development. Additionally, observing which genes switch on and off in response to external treatments can shed light on how genetic variation can drive errors in gene regulation and cause diseases. Stem cells can produce more cells like themselves or differentiate - acquire the characteristics - of many cell types. These cells have been used in the laboratory to research gene regulation. Unfortunately, these studies often fail to capture the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of stem cell differentiation; in particular, these studies are unable to observe gene regulation in the transient cell types that appear early in embryonic development. To overcome these limitations, scientists developed systems such as embryoid bodies: three-dimensional aggregates of stem cells that, when grown under certain conditions, spontaneously develop into a variety of cell types. Rhodes, Barr et al. wanted to assess the utility of embryoid bodies as a model to study how genes are dynamically regulated in different cell types, by different individuals who have distinct genetic makeups. To do this, they grew embryoid bodies made from human stem cells from different individuals to examine which genes switched on and off as the stem cells that formed the embryoid bodies differentiated into different types of cells. The results showed that it was possible to grow embryoid bodies derived from genetically distinct individuals that consistently produce diverse cell types, similar to those found during human fetal development. Rhodes, Barr et al.'s findings suggest that embryoid bodies are a useful model to study gene regulation across individuals with different genetic backgrounds. This could accelerate research into how genetics are associated with disease by capturing gene regulatory dynamics at an unprecedentedly high spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, embryoid bodies could be used to explore how exposure to different environmental factors during early development affect disease-related outcomes in adulthood in different individuals.","10.7554/elife.71361; 10.7554/elife.71361.sa0; 10.7554/elife.71361.sa1; 10.7554/elife.71361.sa2",30014,"Web of Science","r"

In the context of infectious and immune-mediated intestinal disease, interleukin (IL) 22 is thought to augment these processes. We sought to define the mechanisms by which IL22 promotes mucosal healing. METHODS: Intestinal stem cell cultures and mice were treated with recombinant IL22. Cell proliferation, death, and differentiation were assessed in vitro and in vivo by morphometric analysis, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: IL22 increased the size and number of proliferating cells within enteroids but decreased the total number of enteroids. Enteroid size increases required IL22-dependent up-regulation of the tight junction cation and water channel claudin-2, indicating that enteroid enlargement reflected paracellular flux-induced swelling. However, claudin-2 did not contribute to IL22-dependent enteroid loss, depletion of Lgr5(+) stem cells, or increased epithelial proliferation. IL22 induced stem cell apoptosis but, conversely, enhanced proliferation within and expanded numbers of transit-amplifying cells. These changes were associated with reduced wnt and notch signaling, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as skewing of epithelial differentiation, with increases in Paneth cells and reduced numbers of enteroendocrine cells. CONCLUSIONS: IL22 promotes transit-amplifying cell proliferation but reduces Lgr5(+) stem cell survival by inhibiting notch and wnt signaling. IL22 can therefore promote or inhibit mucosal repair, depending on whether effects on transit-amplifying or stem cells predominate. These data may explain why mucosal healing is difficult to achieve in some inflammatory bowel disease patients despite markedly elevated IL22 production.","10.1016/j.jcmgh.2018.09.006",10722,"PubMed","u"

It was uncovered that rmIL-10 increased the size and death, but reduced the total number of organoids. In addition, rmIL-10 depleted Lgr5(+) ISCs and reduced epithelial proliferation, but enhanced the differentiation of epithelial cells and expanded numbers of transit-amplifying (TA) cells. These changes are related to the decrease of Wnt and Notch signals in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, increased expression of Paneth cells and decreased expression of enteroendocrine cells and goblet cells were induced by rmIL-10. Thus, our data indicate that IL-10 reduces the survival of Lgr5(+) ISCs and proliferation of epithelial cells by inhibiting Notch and Wnt signaling, but promotes enhanced the differentiation of epithelial cells and expanded numbers of TA cells. Therefore, IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory factor, but may damage intestinal mucosa repair and maybe a potential target for the treatment of intestinal injury.","10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.014",20005,"PubMed","u"
"Ohno, H.","Intestinal M cells","Journal of Biochemistry","We have an enormous number of commensal bacteria in our intestine, moreover, the foods that we ingest and the water we drink is sometimes contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. The intestinal epithelium is always exposed to such microbes, friend or foe, so to contain them our gut is equipped with specialized gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), literally the largest peripheral lymphoid tissue in the body. GALT is the intestinal immune inductive site composed of lymphoid follicles such as Peyer's patches. M cells are a subset of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) residing in the region of the epithelium covering GALT lymphoid follicles. Although the vast majority of IEC function to absorb nutrients from the intestine, M cells are highly specialized to take up intestinal microbial antigens and deliver them to GALT for efficient mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. I will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of M-cell differentiation and functions.  2015 The Authors.","10.1093/jb/mvv121",40730,"Scopus","u"
"Stange DE","Intestinal stem cells.","Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)","The intestine has become a prime model system to study stem cell biology. Intestinal stem cells can be identified based on the expression of a unique marker gene, namely Lgr5. A transgenic mouse model expressing green fluorescent protein in intestinal stem cells has allowed their visualization, isolation, molecular characterization and use in generating organoids: small mini-guts that contain all cell types of the intestine. Detailing the behavior of intestinal stem cells has also led to new insights concerning the mechanism of self-renewal versus differentiation. Genes and pathways directing daughter cells of stem cells towards the differentiated lineages of the intestine are getting better defined. Of all differentiated cells, Paneth cells play a distinguished role: they emerged from pure bystanders to the guardians of the stem cell. Taken together, a detailed molecular picture emerges that describes the mechanisms of intestinal homeostatic self-renewal and outlines new therapeutic avenues.","10.1159/000355231",22082,"PubMed","u"

In this study we generated humanized UGT1A1 mice expressing the human UGT1A1 gene in either liver (hUGT1A1(HEP)) or intestine (hUGT1A1(GI)), enabling experiments to examine tissue-specific properties of UGT1A1-specific glucuronidation. Hepatic and intestinal tissue-specific expression and function of UGT1A1 were demonstrated. Although the liver is considered a major organ for detoxification, intestinal UGT1A1 is an important contributor for drug clearance. Mice were challenged with irinotecan (CPT-11), a prodrug hydrolyzed by carboxylesterases to form the active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) and detoxified by UGT1A1.

Regenerating the kidney requires the induction of the more than 20 distinct cell types required for excretion and the regulation of pH, and electrolyte and fluid balance. We have previously described the simultaneous induction of progenitors for both collecting duct and nephrons via the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. Paradoxically, although both are of intermediate mesoderm in origin, collecting duct and nephrons have distinct temporospatial origins. Here we identify the developmental mechanism regulating the preferential induction of collecting duct versus kidney mesenchyme progenitors. Using this knowledge, we have generated kidney organoids that contain nephrons associated with a collecting duct network surrounded by renal interstitium and endothelial cells. Within these organoids, individual nephrons segment into distal and proximal tubules, early loops of Henle, and glomeruli containing podocytes elaborating foot processes and undergoing vascularization. When transcription profiles of kidney organoids were compared to human fetal tissues, they showed highest congruence with first trimester human kidney. Furthermore, the proximal tubules endocytose dextran and differentially apoptose in response to cisplatin, a nephrotoxicant. Such kidney organoids represent powerful models of the human organ for future applications, including nephrotoxicity screening, disease modelling and as a source of cells for therapy.","10.1038/nature15695",14757,"PubMed","k"

These advantages enable cancer researchers to directly compare tumor and normal tissue models to better study tumor initiation as well as therapeutic efficacy.

Accordingly, we utilized 3D culture to study elongation in an experimentally accessible setting. We first used antibodies to localize RTK signals and discovered that phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK) was spatially enriched in cells near the front of elongating ducts, whereas phosphorylated AKT was ubiquitous. We next observed a gradient of cell migration speeds from rear to front of elongating ducts, with the front characterized by both high pERK and the fastest cells. Furthermore, cells within elongating ducts oriented both their protrusions and their migration in the direction of tube elongation. By contrast, cells within the organoid body were isotropically protrusive. We next tested the requirement for proliferation and migration. Early inhibition of proliferation blocked the creation of migratory cells, whereas late inhibition of proliferation did not block continued duct elongation. By contrast, pharmacological inhibition of either MEK or Rac1 signaling acutely blocked both cell migration and duct elongation.

In this report, we demonstrate a critical role for lung mesenchymal stromal cell (L-MSC) aging in determining the capacity to form three-dimensional organoids or `alveolospheres' with type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s). In contrast to L-MSCs from aged mice, young L-MSCs support the efficient formation of alveolospheres when co-cultured with young or aged AEC2s. Aged L-MSCs demonstrated features of cellular senescence, altered bioenergetics, and a senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP). The reactive oxygen species generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), was highly activated in aged L-MSCs and Nox4 downregulation was sufficient to, at least partially, reverse this age-related energy deficit, while restoring the self-organizing capacity of alveolospheres. Together, these data indicate a critical role for cellular bioenergetics and redox homeostasis in an organoid model of self-organization and support the concept of thermodynamic entropy in aging biology. eLife digest Many tissues in the body are capable of regenerating by replacing defective or worn-out cells with new ones. This process relies heavily on stem cells, which are precursor cells that lack a set role in the body and can develop into different types of cells under the right conditions. Tissues often have their own pool of stem cells that they use to replenish damaged cells. But as we age, this regeneration process becomes less effective. Many of our organs, such as the lungs, are lined with epithelial cells. These cells form a protective barrier, controlling what substances get in and out of the tissue. Alveoli are parts of the lungs that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to move between the blood and the air in the lungs. And alveoli rely on an effective epithelial cell lining to work properly. To replenish these epithelial cells, alveoli have pockets, in which a type of epithelial cell, known as AEC2, lives. These cells can serve as stem cells, developing into a different type of cell under the right conditions. To work properly, AEC2 cells require close interactions with another type of cell called L-MSC, which supports the maintenance of other cells and also has the ability to differentiate into several other cell types. Both cell types can be found close together in these stem cell pockets. So far, it has been unclear how aging affects how these cells work together to replenish the epithelial lining of the alveoli. To investigate, Chanda et al. probed AEC2s and L-MSCs in the alveoli of young and old mice. The researchers collected both cell types from young (2-3 months) and aged (22-24 months) mice. Various combinations of these cells were grown to form 3D structures, mimicking how the cells grow in the lungs. Young L-MSCs formed normal 3D structures with both young and aged AEC2 cells. But aged L-MSCs developed abnormal, loose structures with AEC2 cells (both young and old cells). Aged L-MSCs were found to have higher levels of an enzyme (called Nox4) that produces oxidants and other `pro-aging' factors, compared to young L-MSCs. However, reducing Nox4 levels in aged L-MSCs allowed these cells to form normal 3D structures with young AEC2 cells, but not aged AEC2 cells. These findings highlight the varying effects specific stem cells have, and how their behaviour is affected by pro-aging factors. Moreover, the pro-aging enzyme Nox4 shows potential as a therapeutic target - downregulating its activity may reverse critical effects of aging in cells.","10.7554/elife.68049; 10.7554/elife.68049.sa1; 10.7554/elife.68049.sa2",28510,"Web of Science","r"

To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we established and characterized endometrial assembloids, consisting of gland-like organoids and primary stromal cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that decidualized assembloids closely resemble midluteal endometrium, harbouring differentiated and senescent subpopulations in both glands and stroma. We show that acute senescence in glandular epithelium drives secretion of multiple canonical implantation factors, whereas in the stroma it calibrates the emergence of anti-inflammatory decidual cells and pro-inflammatory senescent decidual cells. Pharmacological inhibition of stress responses in pre-decidual cells accelerated decidualization by eliminating the emergence of senescent decidual cells. In co-culture experiments, accelerated decidualization resulted in entrapment of collapsed human blastocysts in a robust, static decidual matrix. By contrast, the presence of senescent decidual cells created a dynamic implantation environment, enabling embryo expansion and attachment, although their persistence led to gradual disintegration of assembloids. Our findings suggest that decidual senescence controls endometrial fate decisions at implantation and highlight how endometrial assembloids may accelerate the discovery of new treatments to prevent reproductive failure. eLife digest At the beginning of a human pregnancy, the embryo implants into the uterus lining, known as the endometrium. At this point, the endometrium transforms into a new tissue that helps the placenta to form. Problems in this transformation process are linked to pregnancy disorders, many of which can lead to implantation failure (the embryo fails to invade the endometrium altogether) or recurrent miscarriages (the embryo implants successfully, but the interface between the placenta and the endometrium subsequently breaks down). Studying the implantation of human embryos directly is difficult due to ethical and technical barriers, and animals do not perfectly mimic the human process, making it challenging to determine the causes of pregnancy disorders. However, it is likely that a form of cellular arrest called senescence, in which cells stop dividing but remain metabolically active, plays a role. Indeed, excessive senescence in the cells that make up the endometrium is associated with recurrent miscarriage, while a lack of senescence is associated with implantation failure. To study this process, Rawlings et al. developed a new laboratory model of the human endometrium by assembling two of the main cell types found in the tissue into a three-dimensional structure. When treated with hormones, these `assembloids' successfully mimic the activity of genes in the cells of the endometrium during implantation. Rawlings et al. then exposed the assembloids to the drug dasatinib, which targets and eliminates senescent cells. This experiment showed that assembloids become very robust and static when devoid of senescent cells. Rawlings et al. then studied the interaction between embryos and assembloids using time-lapse imaging. In the absence of dasatinib treatment, cells in the assembloid migrated towards the embryo as it expanded, a process required for implantation. However, when senescent cells were eliminated using dasatinib, this movement of cells towards the embryo stopped, and the embryo failed to expand, in a situation that mimicks implantation failure. The assembloid model of the endometrium may help scientists to study endometrial defects in the lab and test potential treatments. Further work will include other endometrial cell types in the assembloids, and could help increase the reliability of the model. However, any drug treatments identified using this model will need further research into their safety and effectiveness before they can be offered to patients.","10.7554/elife.69603; 10.7554/elife.69603.sa1; 10.7554/elife.69603.sa2",22847,"Web of Science","r"

The cells within the organoids were androgen receptor-positive adenocarcinoma cells, but not p63-positive basal cells. The cells in the organoids responded to interleukin-17A treatment differently from the cells in the monolayer culture. The present study suggests that LNCaP and C4-2B cells are able to form organoids under the defined organoid culture conditions.",NA,10570,"PubMed","k"

Each of these segments or somites originates early in embryonic development. Cells from each somite then divide, grow and specialize to form bones such as the vertebrae of the vertebral column, muscles, skin, and other tissues that make up each segment. Studying different animals during embryonic development has provided insights into how somites form and grow, but it is technically difficult to do and only provides an approximate model of how somites develop in humans. Being able to make and study somites using human cells in the lab would help scientists learn more about how somite formation in humans is regulated. Budjan et al. grew human stem cells in the lab as three-dimensional structures called organoids, and used chemical signals similar to the ones produced in the embryo during development to make the cells form somites. Various combinations of signals were tested to find the best way to trigger somite formation. Once the somites formed, Budjan et al. measured them and studied their structure and the genes they used. They found that these lab-grown somites have the same size and structure as natural somites and use many of the same genes. This new organoid model provides a way to study human somite formation and development in the lab for the first time. This can provide insights into the development and evolution of humans and other animals that could then help scientists understand diseases such as the development of abnormal spinal curvature that affects around 1 in 10,000 newborns. During the development of the vertebrate embryo, segmented structures called somites are periodically formed from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and give rise to the vertebral column. While somite formation has been studied in several animal models, it is less clear how well this process is conserved in humans. Recent progress has made it possible to study aspects of human paraxial mesoderm (PM) development such as the human segmentation clock in vitro using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs); however, somite formation has not been observed in these monolayer cultures. Here, we describe the generation of human PM organoids from hPSCs (termed Somitoids), which recapitulate the molecular, morphological, and functional features of PM development, including formation of somite-like structures in vitro. Using a quantitative image-based screen, we identify critical parameters such as initial cell number and signaling modulations that reproducibly yielded formation of somite-like structures in our organoid system. In addition, using single-cell RNA-sequencing and 3D imaging, we show that PM organoids both transcriptionally and morphologically resemble their in vivo counterparts and can be differentiated into somite derivatives. Our organoid system is reproducible and scalable, allowing for the systematic and quantitative analysis of human spine development and disease in vitro.","10.7554/elife.68925; 10.7554/elife.68925.sa0; 10.7554/elife.68925.sa1; 10.7554/elife.68925.sa2",24545,"Web of Science","r"

With these 3D models, we have characterized the cell populations comprising the pleural effusion aspirate and have tracked phenotypic changes that develop during short-term in vitro culture. We found that isolated, patient cells placed directly into organoids created anatomically relevant structures and exhibited lung cancer specific behaviors. On the other hand, cells first grown in plastic dishes and then cultured in 3D did not create similar structures. Further, we have been able to compare chemotherapeutic response of patient cells between 2D and 3D cell culture systems. Our results show that cells in 2D culture were more sensitive to treatment when compared with 3D organoids.

Finding a model that properly accounts for all these criteria remains difficult. This review summarizes the five primary models currently in use: human PDAC cell line, cell line xenograft, patient derived xenograft, genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), and organoids.

However, it is unclear whether proapoptotic capacity promotes or inhibits replication in this tissue. We infected mice with two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in the capacity to alter immunological tolerance to new food antigen. Infection with reovirus strain T1L, which induces an inflammatory immune response to fed antigen, is prolonged in the intestine, whereas T3D-RV, which does not induce this response, is rapidly cleared from the intestine. Compared with T1L, T3D-RV infection triggered apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent sloughing of dead cells into the intestinal lumen. We conclude that the infection advantage of T1L derives from its capacity to subvert host restriction by epithelial cell apoptosis, providing a possible mechanism by which T1L enhances inflammatory signals during antigen feeding. Using a panel of T1L  T3D-RV reassortant viruses, we identified the viral M1 and M2 gene segments as determinants of reovirusinduced apoptosis in the intestine. Expression of the T1L M1 and M2 genes in a T3D-RV background was sufficient to limit epithelial cell apoptosis and enhance viral infection to levels displayed by T1L. These findings define additional reovirus gene segments required for enteric infection of mice and illuminate the antiviral effect of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis in limiting enteric viral infection. Viral strainspecific differences in the capacity to infect the intestine may be useful in identifying viruses capable of ameliorating tolerance to fed antigen in autoimmune conditions like celiac disease.  2018 American Society for Microbiology.","10.1128/jvi.002062-17",39716,"Scopus","r"

Compared with T1L, T3D-RV infection triggered apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent sloughing of dead cells into the intestinal lumen. We conclude that the infection advantage of T1L derives from its capacity to subvert host restriction by epithelial cell apoptosis, providing a possible mechanism by which T1L enhances inflammatory signals during antigen feeding. Using a panel of T1L  T3D-RV reassortant viruses, we identified the viral M1 and M2 gene segments as determinants of reovirus-induced apoptosis in the intestine. Expression of the T1L M1 and M2 genes in a T3D-RV background was sufficient to limit epithelial cell apoptosis and enhance viral infection to levels displayed by T1L. These findings define additional reovirus gene segments required for enteric infection of mice and illuminate the antiviral effect of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis in limiting enteric viral infection. Viral strain-specific differences in the capacity to infect the intestine may be useful in identifying viruses capable of ameliorating tolerance to fed antigen in autoimmune conditions like celiac disease.IMPORTANCE Acute viral infections are thought to be cleared by the host with few lasting consequences. However, there may be much broader and long-lasting effects of viruses on immune homeostasis. Infection with reovirus, a common, nonpathogenic virus, triggers inflammation against innocuous food antigens, implicating this virus in the development of celiac disease, an autoimmune intestinal disorder triggered by exposure to dietary gluten. Using two reovirus strains that differ in the capacity to abrogate oral tolerance, we found that strain-specific differences in the capacity to replicate in the intestine inversely correlate with the capacity to induce apoptotic death of intestinal epithelial cells, providing a host-mediated process to restrict intestinal infection. This work contributes new knowledge about virus-host interactions in the intestine and establishes a foundation for future studies to define mechanisms by which viruses break oral tolerance in celiac disease.","10.1128/jvi.02062-17",18096,"PubMed","k"

Depending on the location and extent, nevus sebaceous causes only a cosmetic problem during childhood; however, the development of benign and malignant neoplasms on the lesion is the most severe complication during adulthood. The association between nevus sebaceous and various benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms is well documented. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant lesion, and syrin-gocystadenoma papilliferum (SP) is the most common benign tumor associated with nevus sebaceous. Development of squamous cell carcinoma within NS is very rare. The literature contains only a few reports of simultaneous multiple malignant tumors developing on nevus sebaceous.

It has been recently demonstrated that expansion of primary cells into three-dimensional prostatic organoids better mimics prostate epithelial glands by recapitulating epithelial differentiation and cell polarity. Here, we sought to identify cell populations present in monolayer PrE cells and organoid culture, grown from the same patient, using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool to analyze transcriptome profiles of thousands of individual cells simultaneously, creating an in-depth atlas of cell populations within a sample. Organoids consisted of six distinct cell clusters (populations) of intermediate differentiation compared to only three clusters in the monolayer prostate epithelial cells. Integrated analysis of the datasets allowed for direct comparison of the monolayer and organoid samples and identified 10 clusters, including a distinct putative prostate stem cell population that was high in Keratin 13 (KRT13), Lymphocyte Antigen 6D (LY6D), and Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA). Many of the genes within the clusters were validated through RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence in PrE samples from 5 additional patients. KRT13+ cells were observed in discrete areas of the parent tissue and organoids. Pathway analyses and lack of EdU incorporation corroborated a stem-like phenotype based on the gene expression and quiescent state of the KRT13+ cluster.

Airway organoids can serve as an ex vivo human airway model to study respiratory viral pathogenesis; however, they rely on invasive techniques to obtain patient samples. Here, we report a noninvasive technique to generate human nose organoids (HNOs) as an alternative to biopsy-derived organoids. We made air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures from HNOs and assessed infection with two major human respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infected HNO-ALI cultures recapitulate aspects of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral shedding, ciliary damage, innate immune responses, and mucus hypersecretion. Next, we evaluated the feasibility of the HNO-ALI respiratory virus model system to test the efficacy of palivizumab to prevent RSV infection. Palivizumab was administered in the basolateral compartment (circulation), while viral infection occurred in the apical ciliated cells (airways), simulating the events in infants. In our model, palivizumab effectively prevented RSV infection in a concentration dependent manner. Thus, the HNO-ALI model can serve as an alternative to lung organoids to study respiratory viruses and test therapeutics.

Micro-nanofluidic systems of the brain can utilize the entire spectrum of organoid technology. Notably, there is an urgent clinical need for a physiologically relevant microfluidic platform that can mimic the brain. Brain diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and this number will grow as the size of elderly population increases, thus making brain disease a serious public health problem. Brain disease modeling typically involves the use of in vivo rodent models, which is time consuming, resource intensive, and arguably unethical because many animals are required for a single study. Moreover, rodent models may not accurately predict human diseases, leading to erroneous results, thus rendering animal models poor predictors of human responses to treatment. Various clinical researchers have highlighted this issue, showing that initial physiological descriptions of animal models rarely encompass all the desired human features, including how closely the model captures what is observed in patients. Consequently, such animal models only mimic certain disease aspects, and they are often inadequate for studying how a certain molecule affects various aspects of a disease. Thus, there is a great need for the development of the brain-on-a-chip technology based on which a human brain model can be engineered by assembling cell lines to generate an organ-level model. To produce such a brain-on-a-chip device, selection of appropriate cells lines is critical because brain tissue consists of many different neuronal subtypes, including a plethora of supporting glial cell types.

Real-time measurements of cell properties, such as mass and Young's modulus, can yield important insights into many aspects of cell growth and metabolism as well as the interaction of cells with external stimuli (e.g., drugs). Vibrational test structures designed for the study of such cell properties often use fixed configurations and operational modes, with associated limitations in determining multiple characteristics of the cell, simultaneously. Recent development of mechanics-guided techniques for deterministic assembly of three-dimensional (3D) microstructures provides a route to vibrational frameworks that offer tunable configurations, vibration modes, and resonant frequencies. Here we propose a method that exploits such tunable vibrational structures to simultaneously determine the mass and modulus of a single adherent cell, or of other biological materials or small-scale living systems (e.g., organoids), through theoretical modeling and finite element analysis. The idea involves a 3D architecture that supports two different vibrational structures and can be converted from one to the other through application of strain to an elastomeric substrate. Specifically, tailored designs for serpentine ribbons in these systems enable a decoupling of the dependence of the resonant frequencies of the two structures to the cell mass and modulus, with an associated ability to measure these two properties accurately and independently. These same concepts can be scaled to apply to various types of cells, as well as to organoids (3D clusters of cells) and other biological materials with small geometries, across a range of values of mass and modulus. This method could serve as the foundation for microelectromechanical systems capable of monitoring mass and modulus in real time for use in research in biomechanics and dynamic biological processes.

The goals of this study were to develop an efficient protocol for generating retinal organoids from stem cells and examine the morphogenesis of rods in vitro. Method(s): To assess rod photoreceptor differentiation in retinal organoids, we took advantage of Nrl-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice that show rod-specific expression of GFP directed by the promoter of leucine zipper transcription factor NRL.

"Chen HY and Kaya KD and Dong L and Swaroop A","Three-dimensional retinal organoids from mouse pluripotent stem cells mimic in vivo development with enhanced stratification and rod photoreceptor differentiation.","Molecular vision","PURPOSE: The generation of three-dimensional (3D) organoids with optic cup-like structures from pluripotent stem cells has created opportunities for investigating mammalian retinal development in vitro. However, retinal organoids in culture do not completely reflect the developmental state and in vivo architecture of the rod-dominant mouse retina. The goals of this study were to develop an efficient protocol for generating retinal organoids from stem cells and examine the morphogenesis of rods in vitro. METHODS: To assess rod photoreceptor differentiation in retinal organoids, we took advantage of Nrl-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice that show rod-specific expression of GFP directed by the promoter of leucine zipper transcription factor NRL. Using embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (ESCs and iPSCs, respectively) derived from the Nrl-GFP mouse, we were successful in establishing long-term retinal organoid cultures using modified culture conditions (called High Efficiency Hypoxia Induced Generation of Photoreceptors in Retinal Organoids, or HIPRO). RESULTS: We demonstrated efficient differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to retinal structures. More than 70% of embryoid bodies formed optic vesicles at day (D) 7, >50% produced optic cups by D10, and most of them survived until at least D35. The HIPRO organoids included distinct inner retina neurons in a somewhat stratified architecture and mature Mller glia spanning the entire retina. Almost 70% of the cells in the retinal organoids were rod photoreceptors that exhibited elongated cilia. Transcriptome profiles of GFP+ rod photoreceptors, purified from organoids at D25-35, demonstrated a high correlation with the gene profiles of purified rods from the mouse retina at P2 to P6, indicating their early state of differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: The 3D retinal organoids, generated by HIPRO method, closely mimic in vivo retinogenesis and provide an efficient in vitro model to investigate photoreceptor development and modeling disease pathology.",NA,12697,"PubMed","k"

The cellular morphology of these cultures is physiologically similar to the human airway, with cilia, goblet cells, and club cells facing the inner lumen and basal cells situated at the outer layer. The aim of this study was to compare replication competence, tissue tropism, and host responses elicited by human and avian strains of influenza A virus in ex-vivo human bronchus and human airway organoids. Method(s): Between Sept 29, 2016, and Jan 4, 2017, we obtained ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus and cultured human airway organoids from lung stem cells obtained from human lung tissues removed as part of the routine clinical care of patients undergoing surgical resection at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. We compared viral replication competence, tissue tropism, and cytokine and chemokine induction of avian influenza A viruses isolated from humans (Sh2/H7N9, H5N1/483, H5N6/39715), and human H1N1pdm/415742 in airway organoids and ex-vivo bronchus explant cultures. Finding(s): Virus tropism and replication kinetics of human and avian influenza A viruses in human airway organoids mimicked those found in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus explants. In both airway organoids and bronchus explants, influenza A H1N1 subtype (H1N1) and avian influenza A H7N9 viruses replicated to significantly higher titres than did the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, whereas HPAI H5N6 replication was moderate. H1N1, H7N9, and H5N6 viruses infected ciliated cells and goblet cells, but not basal cells in both airway organoids and bronchus explants. The expression of cytokines, interleukin 6, and interferon beta, and the chemokine regulated-on-activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted, was significantly higher in human airway organoids infected with HPAI H5N1 virus than H1N1pdm/415742, Sh2/H7N9, and H5N6/39715 viruses, and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was significantly higher in human organoids infected with HPAI H5N1 virus than H1N1pdm/415742 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses.

This genetic similarity makes organoids an ideal system in which to test drug efficacy. While many investigators assume human organoids are the ultimate model system, we believe that the generation of epithelial organoids of comparative model organisms has great potential. Many key transport discoveries were made using marine organisms. In this paper, we describe how deriving organoids from the spiny dogfish shark, zebrafish, and killifish can contribute to the fields of comparative biology and disease modeling with future prospects for personalized medicine.",NA,20779,"PubMed","k"

We hypothesized that the expression of Cx43 and contractile function are mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) released by nonmyocytes during the preculture period. Cardiac organoids (200 m diameter) were cultivated in microchannels to enable rapid screening. Three experimental groups were formed: (i) Simultaneous Preculture (ECs+FBs for 48 h, followed by CMs), (ii) Sequential Preculture (ECs for 24 h, FBs for 24 h, followed by CMs), and (iii) Simultaneous Triculture (ECs+FBs+CMs). Controls included CMs only, FBs only, and ECs only groups, and preculture with ECs only or FBs only. The highest VEGF levels were found in the Preculture groups [Simultaneous Preculture, 8.92.7 ng/(mLh-1); Sequential Preculture, 16.63.4 ng/(mLh-1)], as compared with Simultaneous Triculture where VEGF was not detectable, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analytical flow cytometry showed that VEGFR2 was expressed by ECs (86%2 VEGFR2+), FBs (44%1 VEGFR2+), and CMs (49%2 VEGFR2+), showing that all three cell types were capable of responding to changes in VEGF. Addition of anti-VEGF neutralizing IgG (0.4 g/mL) to Simultaneous Preculture resulted in 3-fold decrease in Cx43 mRNA and 1.5-fold decrease in Cx43 protein, while Simultaneous Triculture supplemented with VEGF ligand (30 ng/mL) had a threefold increase in Cx43 mRNA and a twofold increase in Cx43 protein. Addition of a small molecule inhibitor of the VEGFR2 receptor (19.4 nM) to Sequential Preculture caused a 1.4-fold decrease in Cx43 mRNA and a 4.1-fold decrease in Cx43 protein. Cx43 was localized within CMs, and not within FBs or ECs. Enriched CM organoids and Sequential Preculture organoids grown in the presence of VEGFR2 inhibitor displayed low levels of Cx43 and poor functional properties. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling enhanced Cx43 expression and cardiac function in engineered cardiac organoids.

Here, we used XIAP-deficient mice to characterize the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation. In Xiap-/- mice, we observed spontaneous terminal ileitis and microbial dysbiosis characterized by a reduction of Clostridia species. We showed that in inflamed mice, both TNF receptor 1 and 2 (TNFR1/2) cooperated in promoting ileitis by targeting TLR5-expressing Paneth cells (PCs) or dendritic cells (DCs). Using intestinal organoids and in vivo modeling, we demonstrated that TLR5 signaling triggered TNF production, which induced PC dysfunction mediated by TNFR1. TNFR2 acted upon lamina propria immune cells. scRNA-seq identified a DC population expressing TLR5, in which Tnfr2 expression was also elevated. Thus, the combined activity of TLR5 and TNFR2 signaling may be responsible for DC loss in lamina propria of Xiap-/- mice. Consequently, both Tnfr1-/-Xiap-/- and Tnfr2-/-Xiap-/- mice were rescued from dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, RNA-seq of ileal crypts revealed that in inflamed Xiap-/- mice, TLR5 signaling was abrogated, linking aberrant TNF responses with the development of a dysbiosis.

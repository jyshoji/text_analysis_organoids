There is no effective strategy to intervene with TAA progression due to an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis. Insufficiency of NOTCH1 expression is highly related to BAV-TAA, but the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. Methods: A comparative proteomics analysis was used to explore the biological differences between non-diseased and BAV-TAA aortic tissues. A microfluidics-based aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model was constructed to evaluate the effect of NOTCH1 deficiency on contractile phenotype and mitochondrial dynamics of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs). Results: Protein analyses of human aortic tissues showed the insufficient expression of NOTCH1 and impaired mitochondrial dynamics in BAV-TAA. HAoSMCs with NOTCH1-knockdown exhibited reduced contractile phenotype and were accompanied by attenuated mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, we identified that mitochondrial fusion activators (leflunomide and teriflunomide) or mitochondrial fission inhibitor (Mdivi-1) partially rescued the disorders of mitochondrial dynamics in HAoSMCs derived from BAV-TAA patients. Conclusions: The aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model simulates the human pathophysiological parameters of aorta biomechanics and provides a platform for molecular mechanism studies of aortic disease and related drug screening.

The aortic valve, which sits at the entrance of the aorta, is a key component of this system. Its three flaps (or `cusps') are pushed open when the blood exits the heart, and they shut tightly so it does not flow back in the incorrect direction. Nearly 1.4\% of people around the world are born with `bicuspid' aortic valves that only have two flaps. These valves may harden or become leaky, forcing the heart to work harder. This defect is also associated with bulges on the aorta which progressively weaken the artery, sometimes causing it to rupture. Open-heart surgery is currently the only way to treat these bulges (or `aneurysms'), as no drug exists that could slow down disease progression. This is partly because the biological processes involved in the aneurysms worsening and bursting open is unclear. Recent studies have highlighted that many individuals with bicuspid aortic valves also have lower levels of a protein known as NOTCH1, which plays a key signalling role for cells. Problems in the mitochondria - the structures that power up a cell - are also observed. However, it is not known how these findings are connected or linked with the aneurysms developing. To answer this question, Abudupataer et al. analyzed the proteins present in diseased and healthy aortic muscle cells, confirming a lower production of NOTCH1 and impaired mitochondria in diseased tissues. They also created an `aorta-on-a-chip' model where aortic muscle cells were grown in the laboratory under conditions resembling those found in the body - including the rhythmic strain that the aorta is under because of the heart beating. Abudupataer et al. then reduced NOTCH1 levels in healthy samples, which made the muscle tissue less able to contract and reduced the activity of the mitochondria. Applying drugs that tweak mitochondrial activity helped tissues from patients with bicuspid aortic valves to work better. These compounds could potentially benefit individuals with deficient aortic valves, but experiments in animals and clinical trials would be needed first to confirm the results and assess safety. The aorta-on-a-chip model developed by Abudupataer et al. also provides a platform to screen for drugs and examine the molecular mechanisms at play in aortic diseases.","10.7554/elife.69310; 10.7554/elife.69310.sa1; 10.7554/elife.69310.sa2",3335,"Web of Science","r"

However, the impact of mechanical forces on infections leading to diarrheal diseases remains largely unknown. Here, we addressed whether flow and peristalsis impact the infectivity of the human pathogen Shigella within a 3D colonic epithelium using Intestine-Chip technology. Strikingly, infection is significantly increased and minimal bacterial loads are sufficient to invade enterocytes from the apical side and trigger loss of barrier integrity, thereby shifting the paradigm about early stage Shigella invasion. Shigella quickly colonizes epithelial crypt-like invaginations and demonstrates the essential role of the microenvironment. Furthermore, by modulating the mechanical forces of the microenvironment, we find that peristalsis impacts Shigella invasion. Collectively, our results reveal that Shigella leverages the intestinal microenvironment by taking advantage of the microarchitecture and mechanical forces to efficiently invade the intestine.

Stem Cells","BACKGROUND Liver organoids have recently been applied as models for liver disease and drug screening, especially when combined with liver-on-a-chip technologies. Compared to hepatocyte-like cells, primary hepatocytes have high functionality but cannot maintain their function when cultured in vitro. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhance hepatocyte function and maintain hepatocyte metabolism when co-cultured with hepatocytes. MSCs can help induced pluripotent stem cells to generate an organoid structure via the MSC-based traction force triggered by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, primary hepatocytes were co-cultured with MSCs on a liver-derived ECM to generate liver organoids within a short duration. AIM To create hepatocyte organoids by co-culturing primary hepatocytes with MSCs on a porcine liver extracellular matrix (PLECM) gel. METHODS Perfusion and enzymatic hydrolysis were used to form the PLECM gel. Rat hepatocytes and human MSCs were mixed and plated on pre-solidified PLECM gel in a 48-well plate for 48 h to generate organoids. Generated organoids were evaluated through hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, immuno-histological, and immunofluorescence staining, and quantitative PCR for alb, CYP450 gene markers, and urea cycle genes. Culture medium was collected to detect albumin (ALB) and urea production on days 2,4, 6,8,14, and 20. RESULTS The whole porcine liver was perfused and enzymatically hydrolyzed to form a PLECM gel. The structural components and basement membrane composition of the ECM, such as collagen type I, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin, were demonstrated to be retained. Through interaction of human MSCs with the liver-derived ECM, primary hepatocytes and human MSCs assembled together into a 3D construction and generated primary hepatocyte organoids for 48 h. The mRNAs of the gene alb, the CYP450 gene markers cyp1a1, cyp1a2, and cyp3a2 as well as urea cycle genes arg-1, asl, ass-1, cps-1, nags were highly expressed in hepatocyte organoids. Long-term survival of the primary hepatocyte organoids, as well as stable functionality, was demonstrated via ALB and urea production in vitro.

"Hao, H.-C. and Yao, D.-J.","Detection of cancer cells on a chip","Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry","Metastasis is the cause of most cancer mortality. Circulating tumour cells (CTC) are cells that are released from a primary tumour into the bloodstream and that are considered to act as the main promoters of metastasis. These cells are therefore targets for the understanding of tumour biology and an improvement of clinical management of the disease. Early detection of CTC and analysis of their cell surface markers provide critical information for the diagnosis of cancer and its target therapy. CTC are shed into the bloodstream as tumours grow, and are believed to initiate the spread of cancer. The identification and analysis of CTC is thus an important objective for the development of noninvasive cancer diagnosis. Methods of capture and detection of CTC have been complicated and costly, and the captured cells could not be cultured and expanded directly. Because CTC are rare, existing as only a few per one billion blood cells, a highly efficient method is required to capture and to culture CTC for further assay. Chipbased and traditional methods have emerged to isolate, to detect and to characterize CTC. As CTC are a rare event, their investigation requires multidisciplinary considerations of both biological and physical properties. Chip-based biosensor platforms are being introduced into the technology for the quantification of CTC with promising results. This review describes recent progress in the identification of CTC; the approach developed has a simple workflow and scalable multiplexing, which makes it ideal for further investigation of CTC biomarkers.  2015 Bentham Science Publishers.","10.2174/1568026615666150414150950",1271,"Scopus","k"

The identification and analysis of CTC is thus an important objective for the development of non-invasive cancer diagnosis. Methods of capture and detection of CTC have been complicated and costly, and the captured cells could not be cultured and expanded directly. Because CTC are rare, existing as only a few per one billion blood cells, a highly efficient method is required to capture and to culture CTC for further assay. Chip-based and traditional methods have emerged to isolate, to detect and to characterize CTC. As CTC are a rare event, their investigation requires multidisciplinary considerations of both biological and physical properties. Chip-based biosensor platforms are being introduced into the technology for the quantification of CTC with promising results. This review describes recent progress in the identification of CTC; the approach developed has a simple workflow and scalable multiplexing, which makes it ideal for further investigation of CTC biomarkers.",NA,3353,"Web of Science","r"

Here, we model the Ebola hemorrhagic syndrome in a microvessel-on-a-chip system and demonstrate its applicability to drug studies. Luminal infusion of Ebola virus-like particles leads to albumin leakage from the engineered vessels. The process is mediated by the Rho/ROCK pathway and is associated with cytoskeleton remodeling. Infusion of Ebola glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) generates a similar phenotype, indicating the key role of GP(1,2) in this process. Finally, we measured the potency of a recently developed experimental drug FX06 and a novel drug candidate, melatonin, in phenotypic rescue. Our study confirms the effects of FX06 and identifies melatonin as an effective, safe, inexpensive therapeutic option that is worth investigating in animal models and human trials.","10.1016/j.isci.2019.100765",2300,"PubMed","u"

Transwells are traditionally used to study cell interactions; however, their usefulness is limited. To overcome these difficulties, a fetal membrane-organ-on-chip (FM-OO-C) was created to study interactive properties of amnion epithelial cells (AECs) and decidual cells compared to transwell systems. METHODS: Primary AECs and decidual cells from term, nonlaboring fetal membranes were cultured in a 2-chamber (AEC/decidual cell) FM-OO-C device and sandwiched between a semipermeable membrane. Cells were treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or dioxin, and membrane permeability and cellular senescence were measured after 48 hours. The same experiments were conducted in transwells for comparisons. RESULTS: Compared to transwell cultures, FM-OO-C model produced better membrane permeability readings regardless of the side of treatment or time point. Membrane permeabilization was higher in AECs directly treated with CSE (1.6 fold) compared to similar treatment on the decidual side (1.2 fold). In FM-OO-C, treatments forced changes between cellular layers. This was evident when CSE and dioxin-induced senescence on one side of the chamber produced similar changes on the opposite side. This effect was minimal in the transwell system. CONCLUSION: The controlled environment of an FM-OO-C allows for improved signal propagation between cells by minimizing noise and highlighting the small changes between treatments that cannot be seen in conventional transwell devices.

A planar, self-renewing human intestinal monolayer platform based on primary adult gastrointestinal stem cells, termed the 2D crypt model, has been developed to screen for the effects of various compounds on the intestinal epithelium. The 2D crypt platform is based on a standard 12-well plate format and consists of cell culture inserts with a collagen film overlaying an impermeable film patterned with an array of micron-scale holes. This two-chamber format enables a gradient of growth factors to be applied such that the tissue self-organizes into spatially segregated stem and differentiated cell compartments. The patterned monolayer mimics a gut epithelium in possessing a stem cell niche, migrating proliferative and differentiated cells. Once established, the 2D crypts replicate many aspects of in vivo physiology, including cell migration, maturation, and apoptotic cell death. The planar geometry of the system simplifies dosing, sampling, and imaging during assay. An immunofluorescence-based assay was established to quantitatively assess cell density, proliferation, migration, viability, and the abundance and localization of postmitotic lineages as a function of time. The model was used to perform a small-scale screen of compounds, including signaling molecules, endogenous hormones/cytokines, and microbial metabolites, on tissue homeostasis.

Part I: Macroscale modeling approach & validation","Biotechnology and Bioengineering","The dynamic nature of in vitro drug metabolism models demands reliable numerical tools to determine key design parameter values towards high-fidelity cell-based platforms of in vivo drug metabolism. This paper represents the first of a two-part model-based investigation of a 3D dynamic microorgan device (DMD). The prescribed tissue model in this paper is precisely embedded within a DMD by 3D bioprinting hydrogel encapsulated liver cells into a patterned array of microchannels. A perfusing drug substrate is biotransformed by liver cells encapsulated within porous hydrogel walls. Therefore, the free and porous flow regime equations are first solved in tandem to derive the laminar velocity profile and wall shear stresses in the entire shear-mediated flow regime. These equations are then coupled with a convection-diffusion equation and Michaelis-Menten reaction terms, resulting in an effective convection-diffusion-cell kinetics model. A key consideration addressed herein is mechanotransduction where shear stresses on the encapsulated cells alter subcellular liver enzyme reaction rates. Cells are incorporated into the geometric model implicitly (macroscale) as enzyme reaction structures uniformly distributed throughout the DMD length. Transient simulations enable effluent drug metabolite profile determination wherein the proposed macroscale modeling approach is validated with an experimental drug flow study.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","10.1002/bit.25822",2105,"Scopus","u"

This paper represents the second of a two-part model-based investigation where the effect of microscale (single liver cell-level) shear-mediated mechanotransduction on drug biotransformation is deconstructed. Herein, each cell is explicitly incorporated into the geometric model as single compartmentalized metabolic structures. Each cell's metabolic activity is coupled with the microscale hydrodynamic Wall Shear Stress (WSS) simulated around the cell boundary through a semi-empirical polynomial function as an additional reaction term in the mass transfer equations. Guided by the macroscale model-based hydrodynamics, only 9 cells in 3 representative DMD domains are explicitly modeled. Dynamic and reaction similarity rules based on non-dimensionalization are invoked to correlate the numerical and empirical models, accounting for the substrate time scales. The proposed modeling approach addresses the key challenge of computational cost towards modeling complex large-scale DMD-type system with prohibitively high cell densities. Transient simulations are implemented to extract the drug metabolite profile with the microscale modeling approach validated with an experimental drug flow study. The results from the author's study demonstrate the preferred implementation of the microscale modeling approach over that of its macroscale counterpart. Biotechnol.

This chapter will outline future avenues of research in the MPS field, how cutting-edge biotechnology advances are expanding the applications for these systems, and discuss the current and future potential and challenges remaining for the field to address.","10.1007/978-3-030-36588-2_3",2848,"PubMed","k"

Because it is difficult to dissect complex underlying events in murine models, organ-on-a-chip methodology is applied to model vascular and platelet functions in ovarian cancer.

Subsequent perfusion with human platelets within the device's vascular endothelial compartment under microvascular shear conditions for 5 days uncovered organ-to-molecular-level contributions of the endothelium to triggering platelet extravasation into tumors. Further, analysis of effluents available from the device's individual tumor and endothelial chambers revealed temporal dynamics of vascular disintegration caused by cancer cells, a differential increase in cytokine expression, and an alteration of barrier maintenance genes in endothelial cells. These events, when analyzed within the device over time, made the vascular tissue leaky and promoted platelet extravasation.

Micro-nanofluidic systems of the brain can utilize the entire spectrum of organoid technology. Notably, there is an urgent clinical need for a physiologically relevant microfluidic platform that can mimic the brain. Brain diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and this number will grow as the size of elderly population increases, thus making brain disease a serious public health problem. Brain disease modeling typically involves the use of in vivo rodent models, which is time consuming, resource intensive, and arguably unethical because many animals are required for a single study. Moreover, rodent models may not accurately predict human diseases, leading to erroneous results, thus rendering animal models poor predictors of human responses to treatment. Various clinical researchers have highlighted this issue, showing that initial physiological descriptions of animal models rarely encompass all the desired human features, including how closely the model captures what is observed in patients. Consequently, such animal models only mimic certain disease aspects, and they are often inadequate for studying how a certain molecule affects various aspects of a disease. Thus, there is a great need for the development of the brain-on-a-chip technology based on which a human brain model can be engineered by assembling cell lines to generate an organ-level model. To produce such a brain-on-a-chip device, selection of appropriate cells lines is critical because brain tissue consists of many different neuronal subtypes, including a plethora of supporting glial cell types. Additionally, cellular network bio-architecture significantly varies throughout different brain regions, forming complex structures and circuitries; this needs to be accounted for in the chip design process. Compartmentalized microenvironments can also be designed within the microphysiological cell culture system to fulfill advanced requirements of a given application. On-chip integration methods have already enabled advances in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy modeling, which are discussed herein.

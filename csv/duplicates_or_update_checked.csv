"Wang, Yichun and Jeon, Hyunsu",3D cell cultures toward quantitative high-throughput drug screening,TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"3D cell cultures are being utilized for drug discovery and development. However, there are still challenges to implementing them generally in quantitative high throughput screening (HTS) due to the complexity of the 3D architecture, the time-and labor-consuming process, and the lack of compatibility with traditional screening protocols. Therefore, there is a great need for the integration of micro fabrication techniques, automation systems, and high-throughput analytical tools that reveal the pharmacological and toxicological effects of therapeutics using 3D cultures. We first review the current advances in 3D culture models and discuss their key challenges in HTS. Last, we review recent progress and breakthroughs in the automation and high-throughput imaging of 3D culture models, which can be integrated with machine-learning (ML) tools to aid quantitative HTS for drug discovery and development.",10.1016/j.tips.2022.03.014569,51859,Web of Science,r,

Here, we create a partial mouse embryo model to elucidate the principles of epiblast (Epi) and extra-embryonic endoderm co-development (XEn). We trigger naive mouse embryonic stem cells to form a blastocyst-stage niche of Epi-like cells and XEn-like cells (3D, hydrogel free and serum free). Once established, these two lineages autonomously progress in minimal medium to form an inner pro-amniotic-like cavity surrounded by polarized Epi-like cells covered with visceral endoderm (VE)-like cells. The progression occurs through reciprocal inductions by which the Epi supports the primitive endoderm (PrE) to produce a basal lamina that subsequently regulates Epi polarization and/or cavitation, which, in return, channels the transcriptomic progression to VE. This VE then contributes to Epi bifurcation into anterior- and posterior-like states. Similarly, boosting the formation of PrE-like cells within blastoids supports developmental progression.

Moreover, the production of conditioned media remains time-consuming and far from physiological and pathological conditions. Although a few models of co-culture are commercially available, they remain restricted to specific assays and are mostly for two types of cells. Here, 3D-printed inserts are used that are compatible with numerous functional assays. The insert allows the separation of one well of a 6-well plate into four compartments. A wide range of combinations can be set. Moreover, windows are designed in each wall of the compartments so that potential intercellular communication between every compartment is possible in the culture medium in a volume-dependent manner. For example, paracrine intercellular communication can be studied between four cell types in monolayer, in 3D (spheroids), or by combining both. In addition, a mix of different cell types can be seeded in the same compartment in 2D or 3D (organoids) format. The absence of a bottom in the 3D -printed inserts allows the usual culture conditions on the plate, possible coating on the plate containing the insert, and direct visualization by optical microscopy. The multiple compartments provide the possibility to collect different cell types independently or to use, in each compartment, different reagents for RNA or protein extraction. In this study, a detailed methodology is provided to use the new 3D-printed insert as a co -culture system. To demonstrate several capacities of this flexible and simple model, previously published functional assays of cell communication were performed in the new 3D-printed inserts and were demonstrated to be reproducible.

Pathogenic bacteria produce amyloid-like proteins ""curli"" that form biofilms and show functional similarities to human amyloid- (A). These proteins may contribute to neurological disease progression via signaling cascade from the gut to the brain. OBJECTIVE: We propose that curli causes neuroendocrine activation from the gut to brain that promotes central A pathology. METHODS: PGP9.5 and TLR2 levels in response to curli in the lumen of Tg2576 AD mice were analyzed by immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR analysis. Western blot and human 3D in vitro enteroids culture systems were also used. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate bacterial dysbiosis. RESULTS: We found significant increase in bacterial-amyloid curli with elevated TLR2 at the mRNA level in the pre- and symptomatic Tg-AD gut compared to littermate WT controls. This data associates with increased gram-positive bacterial colonization in the ileum of the symptomatic AD mice. We found fundamental evidence for vagus nerve activation in response to bacterial curli. Neuroendocrine marker PGP9.5 was significantly elevated in the gut epithelium of symptomatic AD mice, and this was colocalized with increased TLR2 expression. Enteroids, 3D-human ileal mini-gut monolayer in vitro model system also revealed increase levels of TLR2 upon stimulation with purified bacterial curli fibrils. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the importance of pathological changes within the gut-vagus-brain signaling in response to luminal bacterial amyloid that might play a vital role in central A pathogenesis seen in the AD brain.",10.3233/jad-220106,1661,PubMed,k,

We then analyzed the FAO changes in radiation-induced intestinal injury models regardless of ex vivo (mice enteroids), or in vitro (normal human intestinal epithelial cell lines, HIEC-6). HIEC-6 cells were transduced with lentivirus vector GV392 and treated with puromycin for obtaining CPT1 stable knockout cell lines, named CPT1 KO. CPT1 enzymatic activities of HIEC-6 cells and mice enteroids were also inhibited by pharmaceutical inhibitor ST1326 and Etomoxir (ETO), to study the function of CPT1 in the survival and proliferation of HIEC-6 cells after 60Co gamma irradiation. We found that CPT1 mediated FAO was altered in the small intestine of the SD rats after irradiation, especially, the expression level and enzymatic activity of CPT1 were significantly increased. Similarly, the expression levels of CPT1 were also remarkably enhanced in mice enteroids and HIEC-6 cells after irradiation. CPT1 inhibition decreased the proliferation of the HIEC-6 cells and mice enteroids after irradiation partially by reducing the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways activation, CPT1 inhibition also reduced the proliferation of mice enteroids after irradiation partially by down-regulating the Wnt/-catenin signaling activity.

Proper exploitation of these methods may lead to personalized organ transplants, but to regenerate organs, it is necessary to develop methods for assembling differentiated cells into functional, organ-level tissues. The generation of three-dimensional human tissue models also holds potential for medical advances in disease modeling, as full organ functionality may not be necessary to recapitulate disease pathophysiology. This is specifically true of lung diseases where animal models often do not recapitulate human disease. Here, we present a method for the generation of self-assembled human lung tissue and its potential for disease modeling and drug discovery for lung diseases characterized by progressive and irreversible scarring such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Tissue formation occurs because of the overlapping processes of cellular adhesion to multiple alveolar sac templates, bioreactor rotation, and cellular contraction. Addition of transforming growth factor-1 to single cell-type mesenchymal organoids resulted in morphologic scarring typical of that seen in IPF but not in two-dimensional IPF fibroblast cultures. Furthermore, this lung organoid may be modified to contain multiple lung cell types assembled into the correct anatomical location, thereby allowing cell-cell contact and recapitulating the lung microenvironment. Our bottom-up approach for synthesizing patient-specific lung tissue in a scalable system allows for the development of relevant human lung disease models with the potential for high throughput drug screening to identify targeted therapies.

Fligor CM and Huang KC and Lavekar SS and VanderWall KB and Meyer JS,Differentiation of retinal organoids from human pluripotent stem cells.,Methods in cell biology,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) possess the remarkable ability to differentiate into any cell type of the body, including those of the retina. Through the differentiation of these cells as retinal organoids, it is now possible to model the spatial and temporal development of the human retina using hPSCs, in which retinal progenitor cells produce the entire repertoire of retinal cells, first differentiating into retinal ganglion cells and ending with mature photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Mller glia. Importantly, retinal organoids self-assemble into laminated structures that recapitulate the layering of the human retina with a retinal ganglion cell layer lining the inner layer and a distinctly separate photoreceptor layer occupying the outer layers. This organoid technology has provided access to human tissue for developmental and disease modeling, as well as translational applications such as high throughput drug screening and cell replacement therapies. However, the differentiation of retinal organoids does require some expertise and multiple strategies produce inconsistent results. Here, we describe in detail a well-established and relatively simple method for the generation of retinal organoids.",10.1016/bs.mcb.2020.02.005,4165,PubMed,u,

The differentiation approach is based on the knowledge that insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling together with retinoic acid and triiodothyronine is important for retinal development. After 22 weeks in culture, the organoids form a thick layer of neuroepithelium containing photoreceptors and bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, Mller, and retinal ganglion cells.

Once mature, the egg cell is released into the fallopian tube where it can be potentially fertilized by a sperm. Despite their crucial role, how eggs are made in the ovary is poorly understood. This is because ovaries are hard to access, making it difficult to conduct experiments on them. To overcome this, researchers have built artificial ovaries in the laboratory using stem cells from the embryos of mice which can develop into all cell types in the adult body. By culturing these embryonic stem cells under special conditions, researchers can convert them in to the two main cell types of the developing ovary: germ cells which go on to form eggs, and granulosa cells which help eggs grow and mature. The resulting lab-grown ovary can make eggs that produce live mice when fertilized. This approach has also been applied to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult human cells which have been reprogrammed to a stem-like state. While this has produced human germ cells, generating human granulosa cells has been more challenging. Here, Pierson Smela, Kramme et al. show that activating a specific set of transcription factors (proteins that switch genes on or off) in iPSCs can make them transition to granulosa cells. First, the team tested random combinations of 35 transcription factors which, based on previous literature and genetic data, were likely to play a role in the formation of granulosa cells. This led to the identification of a small number of factors that caused the human iPSCs to develop features and carry out roles seen in mature granulosa cells; this includes producing an important reproductive hormone and supporting the maturation of germ cells. Pierson Smela, Kramme et al. found that growing these granulosa-like cells together with germ cells (also generated via iPSCs) resulted in structures similar to ovarian follicles which help eggs develop. These findings could help researchers build stable systems for studying how granulosa cells behave in human ovaries. This could lead to new insights about reproductive health. An in vitro model of human ovarian follicles would greatly benefit the study of female reproduction. Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors (TFs) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, our cells form ovary-like organoids (ovaroids) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression.

The decades since that momentous achievement have brought ever more rapid innovation and advancement in diabetes research and clinical care. To celebrate the important work of the past century and help to chart a course for its continuation into the next, the Canadian Institutes of Health Researchs Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes and the U.S. National Institutes of Healths National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recently held a joint international symposium, bringing together a cohort of researchers with diverse interests and backgrounds from both countries and beyond to discuss their collective quest to better understand the heterogeneity of diabetes and thus gain insights to inform new directions in diabetes treatment and prevention.

Using live-cell microscopy, these dynamics can be visualized to study, e.g., microbe motility, binding and invasion of host cells, and intrahost-cell survival. Such methodology typically employs confocal imaging of fluorescent tags in tumor-derived cell line infections on glass. This allows high-definition imaging but poorly reflects the host tissue's physiological architecture and may result in artifacts. We developed a method for live-cell imaging of microbial infection dynamics on human adult stem cell-derived intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layers. These IEC layers are grown in apical imaging chambers, optimized for physiological cell arrangement and fast, but gentle, differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging. This allows subsecond visualization of both microbial and epithelial surface ultrastructure at high resolution without using fluorescent reporters. We employed this technology to probe the behavior of two model pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Giardia intestinalis, at the intestinal epithelial surface. Our results reveal pathogen-specific swimming patterns on the epithelium and show that Salmonella lingers on the IEC surface for prolonged periods before host cell invasion, while Giardia uses circular swimming with intermittent attachments to scout for stable adhesion sites. The method even permits tracking of individual Giardia flagella, demonstrating that active flagellar beating and attachment to the IEC surface are not mutually exclusive. This work describes a generalizable and relatively inexpensive approach to resolving dynamic pathogen-IEC layer interactions, applicable even to genetically nontractable microorganisms. IMPORTANCE Knowledge of dynamic niche-specific interactions between single microbes and host cells is essential to understand infectious disease progression. However, advances in this field have been hampered by the inherent conflict between the technical requirements for high-resolution live-cell imaging on the one hand and conditions that best mimic physiological infection niche parameters on the other. Toward bridging this divide, we present a methodology for differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging of pathogen interactions at the apical surface of enteroid-derived intestinal epithelia, providing both high spatial and temporal resolution. This alleviates the need for fluorescent reporters in live-cell imaging and provides dynamic information about microbe interactions with a nontransformed, confluent, polarized, and microvilliated human gut epithelium.

"Rhodes, Katherine and Barr, Kenneth A. and Popp, Joshua M. and Strober, Benjamin J. and Battle, Alexis and Gilad, Yoav",Human embryoid bodies as a novel system for genomic studies of functionally diverse cell types,ELIFE,"Practically all studies of gene expression in humans to date have been performed in a relatively small number of adult tissues. Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types. eLife digest One major goal of human genetics is to understand how changes in the way genes are regulated affect human traits, including disease susceptibility. To date, most studies of gene regulation have been performed in adult tissues, such as liver or kidney tissue, that were collected at a single time point. Yet, gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent, meaning that it is important to gather data from a greater variety of cell types at different stages of their development. Additionally, observing which genes switch on and off in response to external treatments can shed light on how genetic variation can drive errors in gene regulation and cause diseases. Stem cells can produce more cells like themselves or differentiate - acquire the characteristics - of many cell types. These cells have been used in the laboratory to research gene regulation. Unfortunately, these studies often fail to capture the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of stem cell differentiation; in particular, these studies are unable to observe gene regulation in the transient cell types that appear early in embryonic development. To overcome these limitations, scientists developed systems such as embryoid bodies: three-dimensional aggregates of stem cells that, when grown under certain conditions, spontaneously develop into a variety of cell types. Rhodes, Barr et al. wanted to assess the utility of embryoid bodies as a model to study how genes are dynamically regulated in different cell types, by different individuals who have distinct genetic makeups. To do this, they grew embryoid bodies made from human stem cells from different individuals to examine which genes switched on and off as the stem cells that formed the embryoid bodies differentiated into different types of cells. The results showed that it was possible to grow embryoid bodies derived from genetically distinct individuals that consistently produce diverse cell types, similar to those found during human fetal development. Rhodes, Barr et al.'s findings suggest that embryoid bodies are a useful model to study gene regulation across individuals with different genetic backgrounds. This could accelerate research into how genetics are associated with disease by capturing gene regulatory dynamics at an unprecedentedly high spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, embryoid bodies could be used to explore how exposure to different environmental factors during early development affect disease-related outcomes in adulthood in different individuals.",10.7554/elife.71361; 10.7554/elife.71361.sa0; 10.7554/elife.71361.sa1; 10.7554/elife.71361.sa2,51269,Web of Science,r,

Method(s): We employed bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation by using clinical samples and a variety of cell-based assays, including western blot, Transwell assay, patient-derived organoid culture, Immunofluorescence assay, T cell cytotoxicity assay, and flow cytometry. Result(s): Bioinformatics analysis showed a higher IL4I1 expression in colorectal cancer tissues than in normal tissues. In vitro overexpression of IL4I1 enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. In addition, deprivation of Tryptophan (Trp) in cultural medium diminished the oncogenic effect of IL4I1. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation of IL4I1 and AHR expression in the TCGA database of colorectal cancer.

In the context of infectious and immune-mediated intestinal disease, interleukin (IL) 22 is thought to augment these processes. We sought to define the mechanisms by which IL22 promotes mucosal healing. METHODS: Intestinal stem cell cultures and mice were treated with recombinant IL22. Cell proliferation, death, and differentiation were assessed in vitro and in vivo by morphometric analysis, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: IL22 increased the size and number of proliferating cells within enteroids but decreased the total number of enteroids. Enteroid size increases required IL22-dependent up-regulation of the tight junction cation and water channel claudin-2, indicating that enteroid enlargement reflected paracellular flux-induced swelling. However, claudin-2 did not contribute to IL22-dependent enteroid loss, depletion of Lgr5(+) stem cells, or increased epithelial proliferation. IL22 induced stem cell apoptosis but, conversely, enhanced proliferation within and expanded numbers of transit-amplifying cells. These changes were associated with reduced wnt and notch signaling, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as skewing of epithelial differentiation, with increases in Paneth cells and reduced numbers of enteroendocrine cells. CONCLUSIONS: IL22 promotes transit-amplifying cell proliferation but reduces Lgr5(+) stem cell survival by inhibiting notch and wnt signaling.

Deng F and Hu J and Yang X and Wang Y and Lin Z and Sun Q and Liu K,Interleukin-10 expands transit-amplifying cells while depleting Lgr5(+) stem cells via inhibition of Wnt and notch signaling.,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,"Epithelial regeneration is essential for homeostasis and mucosal barrier repair. In this study, we aimed to define the effect of IL-10 on mucosal healing. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) cultures and mice were treated with recombinant mice IL-10 (rmIL-10). The level of cell proliferation, differentiation, death and related signaling pathways for self-renewal of ISCs were measured in vitro and in vivo. It was uncovered that rmIL-10 increased the size and death, but reduced the total number of organoids. In addition, rmIL-10 depleted Lgr5(+) ISCs and reduced epithelial proliferation, but enhanced the differentiation of epithelial cells and expanded numbers of transit-amplifying (TA) cells. These changes are related to the decrease of Wnt and Notch signals in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, increased expression of Paneth cells and decreased expression of enteroendocrine cells and goblet cells were induced by rmIL-10. Thus, our data indicate that IL-10 reduces the survival of Lgr5(+) ISCs and proliferation of epithelial cells by inhibiting Notch and Wnt signaling, but promotes enhanced the differentiation of epithelial cells and expanded numbers of TA cells. Therefore, IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory factor, but may damage intestinal mucosa repair and maybe a potential target for the treatment of intestinal injury.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.014,4385,PubMed,u,

The intestinal epithelium is always exposed to such microbes, friend or foe, so to contain them our gut is equipped with specialized gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), literally the largest peripheral lymphoid tissue in the body. GALT is the intestinal immune inductive site composed of lymphoid follicles such as Peyer's patches. M cells are a subset of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) residing in the region of the epithelium covering GALT lymphoid follicles. Although the vast majority of IEC function to absorb nutrients from the intestine, M cells are highly specialized to take up intestinal microbial antigens and deliver them to GALT for efficient mucosal as well as systemic immune responses.

Intestinal stem cells can be identified based on the expression of a unique marker gene, namely Lgr5. A transgenic mouse model expressing green fluorescent protein in intestinal stem cells has allowed their visualization, isolation, molecular characterization and use in generating organoids: small mini-guts that contain all cell types of the intestine. Detailing the behavior of intestinal stem cells has also led to new insights concerning the mechanism of self-renewal versus differentiation. Genes and pathways directing daughter cells of stem cells towards the differentiated lineages of the intestine are getting better defined. Of all differentiated cells, Paneth cells play a distinguished role: they emerged from pure bystanders to the guardians of the stem cell.

These advantages enable cancer researchers to directly compare tumor and normal tissue models to better study tumor initiation as well as therapeutic efficacy.

SEM and EDS analysis confirmed the formation of heterojunction between Cu, N-TiO2 and g-C3N4 and uniform distribution of C, N, Ti, and O elements in the CN/Cu, N-TiO2-1 composite photocatalyst. UV-vis DRS analysis displayed that N and Cu co-doping can reduce the band gap of the involved catalysts, leading to improvement of light absorption. Pho-toluminescence spectra analysis showed that combining Cu, N-TiO2 and g-C3N4 can improve photogenerated charges separation effectively, demonstrating the formation of g-C3N4/Cu, N-TiO2 heterojunction in CN/Cu, N-TiO2-1 composite photocatalyst.

AD is the most common cause of dementia, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide, and is a major health concern in society. Despite decades of research, the cause of AD is not well understood and there is no effective curative treatment so far. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase understanding of AD pathophysiology in the hope of developing a much-needed cure. Dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis has been challenging as the most commonly used model systems such as transgenic animals and two-dimensional neuronal culture do not fully recapitulate the pathological hallmarks of AD. The recent advent of three-dimensional human brain organoids confers unique opportunities to study AD in a humanised model system by encapsulating many aspects of AD pathology. In the present review, we summarise the studies of AD using human brain organoids that recapitulate the major pathological components of AD including amyloid- and tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and synaptic and circuitry dysregulation.

In this Review, we explore organ-on-a-chip technology as a platform to fulfill this need and examine how this technology may be leveraged to address major technical challenges in organoid research. We also discuss emerging opportunities and future obstacles for the development and application of organoid-on-a-chip technology.",10.1126/science.aaw7894,9256,PubMed,u,
Low LA and Sutherland M and Lumelsky N and Selimovic S and Lundberg MS and Tagle DA,Organs-on-a-Chip.,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Organs-on-chips, also known as ""tissue chips"" or microphysiological systems (MPS), are bioengineered microsystems capable of recreating aspects of human organ physiology and function and are in vitro tools with multiple applications in drug discovery and development. The ability to recapitulate human and animal tissues in physiologically relevant three-dimensional, multi-cellular environments allows applications in the drug development field, including; (1) use in assessing the safety and toxicity testing of potential therapeutics during early-stage preclinical drug development; (2) confirmation of drug/therapeutic efficacy in vitro; and (3) disease modeling of human tissues to recapitulate pathophysiology within specific subpopulations and even individuals, thereby advancing precision medicine efforts. This chapter will discuss the development and evolution of three-dimensional organ models over the past decade, and some of the opportunities offered by MPS technology that are not available through current standard two-dimensional cell cultures, or three-dimensional organoid systems. This chapter will outline future avenues of research in the MPS field, how cutting-edge biotechnology advances are expanding the applications for these systems, and discuss the current and future potential and challenges remaining for the field to address.",10.1007/978-3-030-36588-2_3,11091,PubMed,u,
"Budjan, Christoph and Liu, Shichen and Ranga, Adrian and Gayen, Senjuti and Pourquie, Olivier and Hormoz, Sahand",Paraxial mesoderm organoids model development of human somites,ELIFE,"eLife digest Humans are part of a group of animals called vertebrates, which are all the animals with backbones. Broadly, all vertebrates have a similar body shape with a head at one end and a left and right side that are similar to each other. Although this is not very obvious in humans, vertebrate bodies are derived from pairs of segments arranged from the head to the tail. Each of these segments or somites originates early in embryonic development. Cells from each somite then divide, grow and specialize to form bones such as the vertebrae of the vertebral column, muscles, skin, and other tissues that make up each segment. Studying different animals during embryonic development has provided insights into how somites form and grow, but it is technically difficult to do and only provides an approximate model of how somites develop in humans. Being able to make and study somites using human cells in the lab would help scientists learn more about how somite formation in humans is regulated. Budjan et al. grew human stem cells in the lab as three-dimensional structures called organoids, and used chemical signals similar to the ones produced in the embryo during development to make the cells form somites. Various combinations of signals were tested to find the best way to trigger somite formation. Once the somites formed, Budjan et al. measured them and studied their structure and the genes they used. They found that these lab-grown somites have the same size and structure as natural somites and use many of the same genes. This new organoid model provides a way to study human somite formation and development in the lab for the first time. This can provide insights into the development and evolution of humans and other animals that could then help scientists understand diseases such as the development of abnormal spinal curvature that affects around 1 in 10,000 newborns. During the development of the vertebrate embryo, segmented structures called somites are periodically formed from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and give rise to the vertebral column. While somite formation has been studied in several animal models, it is less clear how well this process is conserved in humans. Recent progress has made it possible to study aspects of human paraxial mesoderm (PM) development such as the human segmentation clock in vitro using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs); however, somite formation has not been observed in these monolayer cultures. Here, we describe the generation of human PM organoids from hPSCs (termed Somitoids), which recapitulate the molecular, morphological, and functional features of PM development, including formation of somite-like structures in vitro. Using a quantitative image-based screen, we identify critical parameters such as initial cell number and signaling modulations that reproducibly yielded formation of somite-like structures in our organoid system. In addition, using single-cell RNA-sequencing and 3D imaging, we show that PM organoids both transcriptionally and morphologically resemble their in vivo counterparts and can be differentiated into somite derivatives. Our organoid system is reproducible and scalable, allowing for the systematic and quantitative analysis of human spine development and disease in vitro.",10.7554/elife.68925; 10.7554/elife.68925.sa0; 10.7554/elife.68925.sa1; 10.7554/elife.68925.sa2,49268,Web of Science,r,

The development of new CRPC treatment strategies is strongly impeded by the scarcity of representative, scalable and transferable preclinical models of advanced, androgen receptor (AR)-driven CRPC. Here, we present contemporary patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and matching PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs) from CRPC patients who had undergone multiple lines of treatment. These models were comprehensively profiled at the morphologic, genomic (n = 8) and transcriptomic levels (n = 81). All are high-grade adenocarcinomas that exhibit copy number alterations and transcriptomic features representative of CRPC patient cohorts. We identified losses of PTEN and RB1, MYC amplifications, as well as genomic alterations in TP53 and in members of clinically actionable pathways such as AR, PI3K and DNA repair pathways. Importantly, the clinically observed continued reliance of CRPC tumors on AR signaling is preserved across the entire set of models, with AR amplification identified in four PDXs. We demonstrate that PDXs and PDXOs faithfully reflect donor tumors and mimic matching patient drug responses. In particular, our models predicted patient responses to subsequent treatments and captured sensitivities to previously received therapies. Collectively, these PDX-PDXO pairs constitute a reliable new resource for in-depth studies of treatment-induced, AR-driven resistance mechanisms. Moreover, PDXOs can be leveraged for large-scale tumor-specific drug response profiling critical for accelerating therapeutic advances in CRPC.",10.3390/cells11223632,46205,PubMed,k,

We have hypothesized that 3D hydrogel-based models will allow for improved disease replication and characterization over standard 2D culture using cells taken directly from patients. Here, we have leveraged the use of 3D hydrogel-based models to create lung cancer organoids using a unique cell source, pleural effusion aspirate, from multiple lung cancer patients. With these 3D models, we have characterized the cell populations comprising the pleural effusion aspirate and have tracked phenotypic changes that develop during short-term in vitro culture. We found that isolated, patient cells placed directly into organoids created anatomically relevant structures and exhibited lung cancer specific behaviors. On the other hand, cells first grown in plastic dishes and then cultured in 3D did not create similar structures. Further, we have been able to compare chemotherapeutic response of patient cells between 2D and 3D cell culture systems. Our results show that cells in 2D culture were more sensitive to treatment when compared with 3D organoids.

PDAC is difficult to study because of its genetic heterogeneity, intricate stromal microenvironment, and complex interplay with our immune system. Finding a model that properly accounts for all these criteria remains difficult. This review summarizes the five primary models currently in use: human PDAC cell line, cell line xenograft, patient derived xenograft, genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), and organoids.

However, current methods for efficient quantification of drug response are limited. Herein, we develop a method for label-free, continuous tracking imaging and quantitative analysis of drug efficacy using PDOs. A self-developed optical coherence tomography (OCT) system was used to monitor the morphological changes of PDOs within 6 days of drug administration. OCT image acquisition was performed every 24 h. An analytical method for organoid segmentation and morphological quantification was developed based on a deep learning network (EGO-Net) to simultaneously analyze multiple morphological organoid parameters under the drug's effect. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) testing was conducted on the last day of drug treatment. Finally, a corresponding aggregated morphological indicator (AMI) was established using principal component analysis (PCA) based on the correlation analysis between OCT morphological quantification and ATP testing. Determining the AMI of organoids allowed quantitative evaluation of the PDOs responses to gradient concentrations and combinations of drugs. Results showed that there was a strong correlation (correlation coefficient >90\%) between the results using the AMI of organoids and those from ATP testing, which is the standard test used for bioactivity measurement. Compared with single-time-point morphological parameters, the introduction of time-dependent morphological parameters can reflect drug efficacy with improved accuracy.

Zhang L and Wang L and Yang S and He K and Bao D and Xu M,Quantifying the drug response of patient-derived organoid clusters by aggregated morphological indicators with multi-parameters based on optical coherence tomography.,Biomedical optics express,"Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) serve as excellent tools for personalized drug screening to predict clinical outcomes of cancer treatment. However, current methods for efficient quantification of drug response are limited. Herein, we develop a method for label-free, continuous tracking imaging and quantitative analysis of drug efficacy using PDOs. A self-developed optical coherence tomography (OCT) system was used to monitor the morphological changes of PDOs within 6 days of drug administration. OCT image acquisition was performed every 24h. An analytical method for organoid segmentation and morphological quantification was developed based on a deep learning network (EGO-Net) to simultaneously analyze multiple morphological organoid parameters under the drug's effect. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) testing was conducted on the last day of drug treatment. Finally, a corresponding aggregated morphological indicator (AMI) was established using principal component analysis (PCA) based on the correlation analysis between OCT morphological quantification and ATP testing. Determining the AMI of organoids allowed quantitative evaluation of the PDOs responses to gradient concentrations and combinations of drugs. Results showed that there was a strong correlation (correlation coefficient >90%) between the results using the AMI of organoids and those from ATP testing, which is the standard test used for bioactivity measurement. Compared with single-time-point morphological parameters, the introduction of time-dependent morphological parameters can reflect drug efficacy with improved accuracy. Additionally, the AMI of organoids was found to improve the efficiency of 5-fluorouracil(5FU) against tumor cells by allowing the determination of the optimum concentration, and the discrepancies in response among different PDOs using the same drug combinations could also be measured.

K.",Role of the tumor microenvironment in malignant melanoma organoids during the development and metastasis of tumors,FRONTIERS IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING-SWITZERLAND,"Over the years, the desire to have better thermal comfort in terms of living has been extensively discussed and is in high demand, especially in metropolitan cities. Alongside the desired outcomes, air conditioning facilities have been implemented, but they also bring negative consequences, such as a high energy bill and multi-dimensional environmental impacts. To counter these problems, a hybrid technique combining the evaporative cooling technique with a venturi-shaped natural ventilation tower is proposed. Evaporative cooling takes advantage of cooling in response to the wind blowing through a layer of wetted surface that is built with permeable materials. Combining with the specially designed venturi-shaped natural ventilation tower to improve the volume intake of wind externally, this system is aimed to reduce temperature and achieve thermal comfort by cooling down the air with circulation in a continuous accumulative mode. To gauge the efficiency and effectiveness of this hybrid technique, an evaporative system known as the wind-induced evaporative cooling (WIEC) system is directly fed into a testing chamber (installed with sensors) fabricated with a scale of 1:6. The system was tested in a hot and humid climate with a temperature range of 27?-34?. The finding shows that our system is able to reduce temperatures up to 3.873? with an output cooling capacity of 9 W-476.3 W, which shows the feasibility of this study.",10.3389/fmech.2023.1069806,50946,Web of Science,r,
Zhou S and Lu J and Liu S and Shao J and Liu Z and Li J and Xiao W,Role of the tumor microenvironment in malignant melanoma organoids during the development and metastasis of tumors.,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,"Malignant melanoma (MM) is the most metastatic and aggressive form of skin cancer, and carries a high risk of death. Immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy and molecular-targeted therapy can prolong the survival of patients with advanced MM significantly. However, the low response rate and inevitable drug resistance prevent further improvements in efficacy, which is closely related to the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME refers to the tumor stroma, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, immune cells, soluble molecules, and extracellular matrix (ECM). The dynamic interaction between the TME and tumor cells is very important for the growth, local invasion, and metastatic spread of tumor cells. A patient-derived organoid (PDO) model involves isolation of tumor tissue from patients with MM and culturing it in vitro in a three-dimensional pattern. Compared with traditional cultivation methods, the PDO model preserves the heterogeneity of the tissue structure of MM and demonstrates the interaction between MM cells and the TME. It can reproduce the characteristics of proliferation, migration, and invasion of MM cells, and better simulate the structural function of MM in vivo. This review explores the role of each TME component in development of the PDO model. This review will provide a reference for research on the drug screening and targeted treatment using PDOs, particularly for the immunotherapy of MM.",10.3389/fcell.2023.1166916,47979,PubMed,k,

Infected HNO-ALI cultures recapitulate aspects of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral shedding, ciliary damage, innate immune responses, and mucus hypersecretion. Next, we evaluated the feasibility of the HNO-ALI respiratory virus model system to test the efficacy of palivizumab to prevent RSV infection. Palivizumab was administered in the basolateral compartment (circulation), while viral infection occurred in the apical ciliated cells (airways), simulating the events in infants. In our model, palivizumab effectively prevented RSV infection in a concentration dependent manner. Thus, the HNO-ALI model can serve as an alternative to lung organoids to study respiratory viruses and test therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Preclinical models that recapitulate aspects of human airway disease are essential for the advancement of novel therapeutics and vaccines. Here, we report a versatile airway organoid model, the human nose organoid (HNO), that recapitulates the complex interactions between the host and virus. HNOs are obtained using noninvasive procedures and show divergent responses to SARS-CoV-2 and RSV infection. SARS-CoV-2 induces severe damage to cilia and the epithelium, no interferon -l response, and minimal mucus secretion. In striking contrast, RSV induces hypersecretion of mucus and a profound interferon -l response with ciliary damage. We also demonstrated the usefulness of our ex vivo HNO model of RSV infection to test the efficacy of palivizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk infants. Our study reports a breakthrough in both the development of a novel nose organoid model and in our understanding of the host cellular response to RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection.",NA,49007,Web of Science,r,

In genetically engi-neered mouse (GEM) models, expression of BRAFV600E in the lung epithelium initiates growth of benign lung tumors that, without additional genetic alterations, rarely progress to malignant lung adenocarcinoma. To identify genes that cooperate with BRAFV600E for malignant progression, we used Sleeping Beauty-mediated transposon mutagenesis, which dramatically accelerated the emer-gence of lethal lung cancers. Among the genes identified was Rbms3, which encodes an RNA-binding protein previously impli-cated as a putative tumor suppressor. Silencing of RBMS3 via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing promoted growth of BRAFV600E lung organoids and promoted development of malignant lung cancers with a distinct micropapillary architecture in BRAFV600E and EGFRL858R GEM models. BRAFV600E/RBMS3Null lung tumors displayed elevated expression of Ctnnb1, Ccnd1, Axin2, Lgr5, and c-Myc mRNAs, suggesting that RBMS3 silencing elevates signaling through the WNT/(3-catenin signaling axis. Although RBMS3 silencing rendered BRAFV600E-driven lung tumors resistant to the effects of dabrafenib plus trametinib, the tumors were sensitive to inhibition of porcupine, an acyltransferase of WNT ligands necessary for their secretion. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas patient samples revealed that chromosome 3p24, which encompasses RBMS3, is frequently lost in non-small cell lung cancer and correlates with poor prognosis. Collectively, these data reveal the role of RBMS3 as a lung cancer suppressor and suggest that RBMS3 silencing may contribute to malignant NSCLC progression.Significance: Loss of RBMS3 cooperates with BRAFV600E to induce lung tumorigenesis, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mutant BRAF-driven lung cancer and potential strategies to more effectively target this disease.",10.1158/0008-5472.can-21-3214noncommercial-noderivatives4.0international,51152,Web of Science,r,

The clinical presentation and the involved sites were noted by the dermatologist, and a clinical diagnosis was made. Biopsy of the lesions was sent for histopathological examination. There are five patients in the series - four are male and one female, with age ranging from 28 to 48 years. Locations included the forearm, arm, anterior chest wall and lateral abdominal wall. The lesions clinically appeared as warty papule or nodules and one lesion appeared within a plaque, with the average duration being 5.3 years. In all five patients, the lesions were clinically suspected to be either tuberculosis verruca cutis or nodular basal cell carcinoma or dermatofibroma sarcoma protuberans (DFSP) or verruca or fibroma or pyogenic granuloma.

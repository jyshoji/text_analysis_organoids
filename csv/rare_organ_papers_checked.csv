We report here the identification and characterisation of the transcriptional regulator, BCL11A, as a LUSC oncogene. Analysis of cancer genomics datasets revealed BCL11A to be upregulated in LUSC but not lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We demonstrated that knockdown of BCL11A in LUSC cell lines abolished xenograft tumour growth and its overexpression in vivo led to lung airway hyperplasia and the development of reserve cell hyperplastic lesions. In addition, deletion of Bcl11a in the tracheal basal cells abolished the development of tracheosphere organoids while its overexpression led to solid tracheospheres with a squamous phenotype. At the molecular level we found BCL11A to be a target of SOX2 and we show that it is required for the oncogenic role of SOX2 in LUSC. Furthermore, we showed that BCL11A and SOX2 interact at the protein level and that together they co-regulated the expression of several transcription factors. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of SETD8, a gene co-regulated by BCL11A and SOX2, alone or in combination with cisplatin treatment, shows significant selectivity to LUSC in comparison to LUAD cells. Collectively, these results indicate that the disruption of the BCL11A-SOX2 transcriptional program provides a future framework for the development of targeted therapeutic intervention for LUSC patients.",NA,"na;  in addition, deletion of bcl11a in the tracheal basal cells abolished the development of tracheosphere organoid while its overexpression led to solid tracheospheres with a squamous phenotype.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",tracheosphere,OK,

However, the mechanisms regulating GEJ homeostasis remain unclear. Here, by employing organoids, bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, single-molecule RNA in situ hybridisations and lineage tracing, we identified the spatial organisation of the epithelial, stromal compartment and the regulators that maintain the normal GEJ homeostasis. During development, common KRT8 progenitors generate committed unilineage p63/KRT5-squamous and KRT8-columnar stem cells responsible for the regeneration of postnatal esophagus and gastric epithelium that meet at GEJ. A unique spatial distribution of Wnt regulators in the underlying stromal compartment of these stem cells creates diverging Wnt microenvironments at GEJ and supports their differential regeneration. Further, we show that these tissue-resident stem cells do not possess the plasticity to transdifferentiate to the other lineage with the altered Wnt signals. Our study provides invaluable insights into the fundamental process of GEJ homeostasis and is crucial for understanding disease development.",NA,"na;  here, by employing organoid, bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, single-molecule rna in situ hybridisations and lineage tracing, we identified the spatial organisation of the epithelial, stromal compartment and the regulators that maintain the normal gej homeostasis.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",gastroesophageal junction,OK,

It is the central organ of the stress response system and has been implicated in numerous stress-related disorders. While for other diseases, regeneration of healthy organ tissue has been aimed at such approaches are lacking for endocrine diseases - with the exception of type-I-diabetes. Moreover, tumor formation is very common, however, appropriate high-throughput applications reflecting the high heterogeneity and furthermore relevant 3D-structures in vitro are still widely lacking. Recently, we have initiated the development of standardized multidimensional models of a variety of endocrine cell/tissue sources in a new multiwell-format. Firstly, we confirmed common applicability for pancreatic pseudo-islets. Next, we translated applicability for spheroid establishment to adrenocortical cell lines as well as patient material to establish spheroids from malignant, but also benign adrenal tumors. We aimed furthermore at the development of bovine derived adrenal organoids and were able to establish steroidogenic active organoids containing both, cells of cortical and medullary origin.

Experimental evidence, primarily from non-mammalian model systems, indicates that the stable formation of this group of cells requires the activation of a set of key transcription factors (TFs). This critical event is challenging to probe in mammals and, quantitatively, little is known regarding the regulation of the transition of cells to this ocular fate. Using optic vesicle organoids to model the onset of the EF, we generate timecourse transcriptomic data allowing us to identify dynamic gene-expression programs that characterise this cellular-state transition. Integrating this with chromatin accessibility data suggests a direct role of canonical EFTFs in regulating these gene-expression changes, and high-lights candidate cis-regulatory elements through which these TFs act. Finally, we begin to test a subset of these candidate enhancer elements, within the organoid system, by perturbing the underlying DNA sequence and measuring transcriptomic changes during EF activation.",characterization of an eye field-like state during opticvesicle organoid development,"na;  using opticvesicle organoid to model the onset of the ef, we generate timecourse transcriptomic data allowing us to identify dynamic gene-expression programs that characterise this cellular-state transition.;  finally, we begin to test a subset of these candidate enhancer elements, within the organoid system, by perturbing the underlying dna sequence and measuring transcriptomic changes during ef activation.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",optic vesicle,OK,

However, due to a paucity of GEJ-specific disease models, cancer-promoting consequences of TP53 and CDKN2A inactivation at the GEJ have been incompletely characterized. Here we report the development of the first wild-type primary human GEJ organoid model, as well as a CRISPR-edited transformed GEJ organoid model. CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to inactivate TP53 and CDKN2A (TP53/CDKN2AKO) in GEJ organoids induced morphologic dysplasia as well as pro-neoplastic features in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Notably, lipidomic profiling identified several Platelet-Activating Factors (PTAFs) among the most upregulated lipids in CRISPR-edited organoids; and importantly, PTAF/PTAFR abrogation by siRNA knockdown or a pharmacologic inhibitor (WEB2086) significantly blocked proliferation and other pro-neoplastic features of TP53/CDKN2AKO GEJ organoids in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. In addition, murine xenografts derived from Eso26, an established esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cell line, were suppressed by WEB2086. Mechanistically, TP53/CDKN2A dual inactivation disrupted both the transcriptome and the DNA methylome, likely mediated by key transcription factors, particularly Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1). Importantly, FOXM1 activated PTAFR transcription by binding to the PTAFR promoter, further amplifying the PTAF-PTAFR pathway. In summary, we established a robust model system for investigating early GEJ neoplastic events, identified crucial metabolic and epigenomic changes occurring during GEJ model tumorigenesis, and discovered a potential cancer-therapeutic strategy, while providing insights into pro-neoplastic mechanisms associated with TP53/CDKN2A inactivation in early GEJ neoplasia.One Sentence Summary Novel tumorigenic FOXM1-PTAFR-PTAF axis revealed by multi-omic profiling in TP53/CDKN2A-double knockout human gastroesophageal junction organoid model.",novel tumorigenic foxm1-ptafr-ptaf axis revealed by multi-omic profiling in tp53/cdkn2a-double knockout human gastroesophageal junction organoid model,"na;  here we report the development of the first wild-type primary human gej organoid model, as well as a crispr-edited transformed gej organoid model.;  crispr/cas9 engineering to inactivate tp53 and cdkn2a (tp53/cdkn2ako) in gej organoid induced morphologic dysplasia as well as pro-neoplastic features in vitro and tumor formation in vivo.;  notably, lipidomic profiling identified several platelet-activating factors (ptafs) among the most upregulated lipids in crispr-edited organoid; and importantly, ptaf/ptafr abrogation by sirna knockdown or a pharmacologic inhibitor (web2086) significantly blocked proliferation and other pro-neoplastic features of tp53/cdkn2ako gej organoid in vitro and tumor formation in vivo.; one sentence summary novel tumorigenic foxm1-ptafr-ptaf axis revealed by multi-omic profiling in tp53/cdkn2a-double knockout human gastroesophageal junction organoid model.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",gastroesophageal junction,OK,

The understanding of parathyroid hyperplastic growth and the development of parathyroid-targeted treatment and imaging tracers could benefit from in vitro models. Therefore, we aim to establish stem cell-derived, three-dimensional organoids representing human parathyroid tissue in vitro. Patient-derived hyperplastic parathyroid tissue was dispersed and parathyroid organoids (PTO) were cultured and characterized. PTO-derived cells were shown to exhibit in vitro self-renewal over several passages, indicative of the presence of putative stem cells. Immunofluorescence and RNA-sequencing confirm that PTO phenocopy hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Exposure of PTO to increasing calcium concentrations and to PTH-lowering drugs resulted in a significantly reduced PTH excretion. Next to this, the PTO showed specific binding of 11C-methionine to the targeted receptor. Additionally, when organoids were incubated with 99mTc-sestamibi, we observed a higher uptake in PTOs from patients with a 99mTc-sestamibi positive scan compared to patients with a negative scan. These data show functionality of PTOs resembling the parathyroid. In conclusion, we present a patient-derived PTO culture, that recapitulates the originating tissue on gene and protein expression and functionality.

Several in vitro methods exist for studying lung epithelial repair using primary murine lung epithelial cells, but isolation methods are hampered by a lack of surface markers distinguishing epithelial progenitors along the respiratory epithelium. Here, we developed a 3D-printed lobe divider (3DLD) to aid in simultaneous isolation of proximal versus distal lung epithelial progenitors from individual mice which give rise to differentiated epithelia in multiple in vitro assays. In contrast to 3DLD-isolated distal progenitor cells, classic manual tracheal ligation methods followed by lobe removal resulted in co-isolation of rare proximal progenitors with distal cells which altered the transcriptional landscape of distal organoid cultures. Thus, cell isolation with the 3DLD generates reproducible distal versus proximal progenitor populations and minimizes the potential for contaminating populations to confound in vitro assays.Highlights3DLD reproducibly separates lung lobes and extrapulmonary airways (bronchi/trachea)3DLD cell isolation yields consistent isolation of distal epithelial cells (DECs)Contamination of proximal cells in classic DEC isolations may alter in vitro results3DLD allows for simultaneous isolation of proximal and DECs from single animalseTOC blurb Alsafadi et al. describes a new method for simultaneous isolation of lung epithelial proximal and distal progenitors using the aid of a 3D printed device (3DLD).

Mutations in a relatively small set of genes account for 75\% of bilateral anophthalmia cases, yet 25\% of families currently are left without a molecular diagnosis. Here we report our experimental work that aimed to uncover the developmental and genetic basis of the anophthalmia characterising the X-linked Ie (eye-ear reduction) X-ray induced allele in mouse that was first identified in 1947. Histological analysis of the embryonic phenotype showed failure of normal eye development after the optic vesicle stage with particularly severe malformation of the ventral retina. Linkage analysis mapped this mutation to a \~{} 6Mb region on the X chromosome. Short and long read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of affected and unaffected male littermates confirmed the Ie linkage but identified no plausible causative variants or structural rearrangements. These analyses did reduce the critical candidate interval and revealed evidence of multiple variants within the ancestral DNA, although none were found that altered coding sequences or that were unique to Ie. To investigate early embryonic events at a genetic level, we then generated mouse ES cells derived from male Ie embryos and wild type littermates. RNA-seq and accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) data generated from cultured optic vesicle organoids did not reveal any large differences in gene expression or accessibility of putative cis-regulatory elements between Ie and wild type. However, an unbiased TF-footprinting analysis of accessible chromatin regions did provide evidence of a genome-wide reduction in binding of transcription factors associated with ventral eye development in Ie, and evidence of an increase in binding of the Zic-family of transcription factors, including Zic3, which is located within the Ie-refined critical interval. We conclude that the refined Ie critical region at chrX: 56,145,000-58,385,000 contains multiple genetic variants that may be linked to altered cis regulation but does not contain a convincing causative mutation. Changes in the binding of key transcription factors to chromatin causing altered gene expression during development, possibly through a subtle mis-regulation of Zic3, presents a plausible cause for the anophthalmia phenotype observed in Ie, but further work is required to determine the precise causative allele and its genetic mechanism.",NA,na;  rna-seq and accessible chromatin sequencing (atac-seq) data generated from cultured opticvesicle organoid did not reveal any large differences in gene expression or accessibility of putative cis-regulatory elements between ie and wild type.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,optic vesicle,OK,

This innovative in vitro model is highly relevant to study physiology of the intestinal epithelium and its role in nutrition and barrier function. However, this model has never been developed in rabbits, while it would have potential applications for biomedical and veterinary research. Here, we cultured rabbit caecum organoids with either pharmacological inhibitors (2Ki medium) or L-WRN cells conditioned medium (L-WRN CM) to reconstitute the intestinal stem cell niche in vitro. Large spherical organoids were obtained with the 2Ki medium and this morphology was associated with a high level of proliferation and stem cells markers gene expression. In contrast, organoids cultured with L-WRN CM had a smaller diameter; a greater cell height and part of them were not spherical. When the L-WRN CM was used at low concentration (5\%) for two days, the gene expression of stem cells and proliferation markers were very low, while absorptive and secretory cells markers and antimicrobial peptides were elevated. Epithelial cells within organoids were polarized in 3D cultures with 2Ki medium or L-WRN CM (apical side towards the lumen). We cultured dissociated organoid cells in 2D monolayers, which allowed accessibility to the apical compartment. Under these conditions, actin stress fibers were observed with the 2Ki medium, while perijonctionnal localization of actin was observed with the L-WRN CM suggesting, in 2D cultures as well, a higher differentiation level in the presence of L-WRN CM. In conclusion, rabbit caecum organoids cultured with the 2Ki medium were more proliferative and less differentiated than organoids cultured with L-WRN CM.

In this study, a novel heterogeneous cell containing a matrix-based 3-dimensional (3D) tissue construct was used to study the interactions between stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) and macrophage for a comprehensive understanding on the cellular signaling mechanisms guiding inflammation and repair. METHODS: SCAPs and macrophages were seeded with collagen in 3D-printed molds to generate self-assembled tissue constructs, which were exposed to 3 conditions: no stimulation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and interleukin (IL)-4 from 0 to 14 days. Specimens from each group were evaluated for cellular interactions, inflammatory mediators (IL-1, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-, macrophage-derived chemokine [MDC], macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1, IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor [TGF]-1, IL-1RA, IL-10), expression of surface markers (CD80, 206), transcription factors (pSTAT1, pSTAT6), and SCAP differentiation markers (dentin sialophosphoprotein [DSPP], dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 [DMP-1], and alizarin red) using confocal laser scanning microscopy and multiplex cytokine profiling from 2 to 14 days. RESULTS: SCAP and macrophages displayed a cytokine-mediated interaction and differentiation characteristics. The increased pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, IL-1, TNF-, MDC, and MIP-1, in the earlier phase followed by the higher ratio of pSTAT6/pSTAT1 and decreased CD206 (P < .05), indicated a distinct polarization behavior in macrophages during repair in the LPS group. Conversely, the equal ratio of pSTAT6/pSTAT1, late increase in CD206, and amplified secretion of IL-1RA, IL-10, and TGF-1 (P < .05) in the anti-inflammatory environment, directed alternative macrophage polarization, promoting SCAP differentiation and tissue modeling in IL-4 group.

It is the central organ of the stress response system and has been implicated in numerous stress-related disorders. While for other diseases, regeneration of healthy organ tissue has been aimed at such approaches are lacking for endocrine diseases - with the exception of type-I-diabetes. Moreover, adrenal tumor formation is very common, however, appropriate high-throughput applications reflecting the high heterogeneity and furthermore relevant 3D-structures in vitro are still widely lacking. Recently, we have initiated the development of standardized multidimensional models of a variety of endocrine cell/tissue sources in a new multiwell-format. Firstly, we confirmed common applicability for pancreatic pseudo-islets. Next, we translated applicability for spheroid establishment to adrenocortical cell lines as well as patient material to establish spheroids from malignant, but also benign adrenal tumors.

1591,Cyr DG and Pinel L,"Emerging organoid models to study the epididymis in male reproductive toxicology.; 3D cell culture and Development and Epididymis and Organoid and Stem cells and Toxicology; The importance of the epididymis on sperm maturation and consequently male fertility has been well documented. The pseudostratified epithelium of the epididymis is comprised of multiple cell types, including principal cells, which are the most abundant, and basal cells. The role of basal cells has been unclear and has been a source of discussion in the literature. However, the recent demonstration that these cells are multipotent or adult stem cells has opened new areas of research in epididymal biology. One such avenue is to understand the regulation of these stem cells, and to exploit their properties to develop tools for toxicological studies to elucidate the effects of chemicals on cell differentiation and epididymal function in vitro. Studies in both rat and mouse have shown that purified single epididymal basal cells cultured under 3D conditions can proliferate and differentiate to form organoids, or mini organs. Furthermore, these epididymal basal stem cells can self-renew and differentiate into other epididymal cell types. It is known that during epididymal development, basal cells are derived from undifferentiated columnar cells, which have been reported to share common properties to stem cells. Like basal cells, these undifferentiated columnar cells can also form organoids under 3D culture conditions and can differentiate into basal, principal and clear cells. Organoids derived from either basal cells or columnar cells offer unique models for toxicology studies and represent an exciting and emerging approach to understand the epididymis.",emerging organoid models to study the epididymis in male reproductive toxicology.,"3d cell culture and development and epididymis and organoid and stem cells and toxicology;  studies in both rat and mouse have shown that purified single epididymal basal cells cultured under 3d conditions can proliferate and differentiate to form organoid, or mini organs.;  like basal cells, these undifferentiated columnar cells can also form organoid under 3d culture conditions and can differentiate into basal, principal and clear cells.;  organoid derived from either basal cells or columnar cells offer unique models for toxicology studies and represent an exciting and emerging approach to understand the epididymis.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",epididymis,OK,

However, the crucial factors and the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we found that heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) accumulates in the mitochondria of HD cell models, a YAC128 mouse model, and human striatal organoids derived from HD induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overexpression of mitochondria-targeting HSF1 (mtHSF1) in the striatum causes neurodegeneration and HD-like behavior in mice. Mechanistically, mtHSF1 facilitates mitochondrial fission by activating dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation at S616. Moreover, mtHSF1 suppresses single-stranded DNA-binding protein 1 (SSBP1) oligomer formation, which results in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion. The suppression of HSF1 mitochondrial localization by DH1, a unique peptide inhibitor, abolishes HSF1-induced mitochondrial abnormalities and ameliorates deficits in an HD animal model and human striatal organoids.

Patients with unrespectable mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma presenting with peritoneal spread are treated by intraperitoneal chemotherapy, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. However, there are no guidelines for efficacious drugs against mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, relevant high-fidelity models should be investigated to identify effective drugs for individual therapy. METHODS: Surgical tumor specimens were obtained from a mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma patient. The tissue was digested and organoid culture was established. H&E and immunohistochemistry staining as well as DNA sequencing was performed on tissue and organoid. The pathological characteristics and gene mutations of the organoid were compared to those of the original tumor. Drug sensitivity tests were performed on organoid and the patient clinical responds to chemotherapy and targeted therapy was compared. RESULTS: Organoids were successfully established and stably passaged. Pathological characteristics of organoids including H&E staining and expression of protein markers (CK20, CDX-2, STAB2, CD7, PAX8) were consistent to those of the original tumor. Moreover, the organoids carried the same gene mutations as the primary tumor. Sensitivity of the organoids to chemotherapeutic drugs and tyrosine kinase inhibitors included: 5-FU (IC(50) 43.95 M), Oxaliplatin (IC(50) 23.49 M), SN38 (IC(50) 1.02 M), Apatinib (IC(50) 0.10 M), Dasatinib (IC(50) 2.27 M), Docetaxel (IC(50) 5.26 M), Regorafenib (IC(50) 18.90 M), and Everolimus (IC(50) 9.20 M). The sensitivities of organoid to these drugs were comparable to those of the patient's clinical responses.

Tissue-specific organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells allow for the in vitro recapitulation of elements of embryonic development. However, they are not intrinsically vascularized, which poses a major challenge for their sustained growth, and for understanding the role of vasculature in fate specification and morphogenesis. Current organoid vascularization strategies do not recapitulate the temporal synchronization and spatial orientation needed to ensure in vivo-like early co-development. Here, we developed a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based approach to generate organoids which interact with vascular cells in a spatially determined manner. The spatial interaction between organoid and vasculature is enabled by the use of a custom designed 3D printed microfluidic chip which allows for a sequential and developmentally matched co-culture system. We show that on-chip hPSC-derived pericytes and endothelial cells sprout and self-assemble into organized vascular networks, and use cerebral organoids as a model system to explore interactions with this de novo generated vasculature. Upon co-development, vascular cells physically interact with the cerebral organoid and form an integrated neurovascular organoid on chip.

Cholangiopathies are associated with bile duct (BD) hyperplasia, including expansion of peribiliary glands, the niche for biliary progenitor cells. The inflammation-associated cytokine interleukin (IL)-33 is also up-regulated in cholangiopathies, including cholangiocarcinoma. We hypothesized that HH signaling synergizes with IL-33 in acute inflammation-induced BD hyperplasia. We measured extrahepatic BD (EHBD) thickness and cell proliferation with and without an IL-33 challenge in wild-type mice, mice overexpressing Sonic HH (pCMV-Shh), and mice with loss of the HH pathway effector glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1lacZ/lacZ). LacZ reporter mice were used to map the expression of HH effector genes in mouse EHBDs. An EHBD organoid (BDO) system was developed to study biliary progenitor cells in vitro. EHBDs from the HH overexpressing pCMV-Shh mice showed increased epithelial cell proliferation and hyperplasia when challenged with IL-33. In Gli1lacZ/lacZ mice, we observed a decreased proliferative response to IL-33 and decreased expression of Il6. The HH ligands Shh and Indian HH (Ihh) were expressed in epithelial cells, whereas the transcriptional effectors Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 and the HH receptor Patched1 (Ptch1) were expressed in stromal cells, as assessed by in situ hybridization and lacZ reporter mice. Although BDO cells lacked canonical HH signaling, they expressed the IL-33 receptor suppression of tumorigenicity 2.

This study aimed to develop and characterize a 3D tissue construct with a binary cell system for studying the interactions between SCAPs and macrophages in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (proinflammatory) and interleukin 4 (anti-inflammatory) environments. METHODS: SCAPs and macrophages were seeded in the 3D-printed dumbbell-shaped molds to generate tissue constructs with a binary cell population. Two experimental (lipopolysaccharide and interleukin 4) and control (non-stimulation) conditions were applied to the tissue constructs to determine the characteristics of the tissue construct, the volume of viable cells, and their morphology using confocal laser scanning microscopy from a 0- to 7-day period. Experiments were conducted in triplicate, and data were analyzed with trend analysis and 2-way analysis of variance at a significance of P < .05. RESULTS: The tissue constructs revealed distinct SCAP-macrophage interaction in pro/anti-inflammatory environments. SCAPs displayed characteristic self-organization as a cap-shaped structure in the tissue construct. The growth of cells and cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions resulted in 70% and 30% decreased dimension of the tissue graft on the SCAP side and macrophage side, respectively, at day 7 (P < .0001). The tissue environments influenced SCAP-macrophage interactions, resulting in an altered viable cell volume (P < .05), morphology, and structural organization.

The eccrine sweat gland develops from the initial solid bud to the final gland structure with a lumen, but how the lumen is formed and the mechanism of lumen formation have not yet been fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of lumen formation of eccrine gland organoids (EGOs). METHODS: Human eccrine sweat glands were isolated from the skin for tissue culture, and the primary cultured cells were collected and cultured in Matrigel for 14 days in vitro. EGOs at different development days were collected for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to observe morphological changes and for immunofluorescence staining of proliferation marker Ki67, cellular motility marker filamentous actin (F-actin), and autophagy marker LC3B. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Ki67, F-actin, and LC3B. Moreover, apoptosis was detected using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis assay kit, and the expression of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and Caspase-3 was detected by Western blot. In addition, 3-methyladenine (3MA) was used as an autophagy inhibitor to detect whether the formation of sweat glands can be effectively inhibited. RESULTS: The results showed that a single gland cell proliferated rapidly and formed EGOs on day 4. The earliest lumen formation was observed on day 6. From day 8 to day 14, the rate of lumen formation in EGOs increased significantly. The immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses showed that the expression of Ki67 gradually decreased with the increase in days, while the F-actin expression level did not change. Notably, the expression of autophagy marker LC3B was detected in the interior cells of EGOs as the apoptosis signal of EGOs was negative. Compared with the control group, the autophagy inhibitor 3MA can effectively limit the formation rate of the lumen and reduce the inner diameter of EGOs. CONCLUSION: Using our model of eccrine gland 3D-reconstruction in Matrigel, we determined that autophagy rather than apoptosis plays a role in the lumen formation of EGOs.","autophagy, not apoptosis, plays a role in lumen formation of sweatgland organoid.",na;  this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of lumen formation of sweatgland organoid (egos).; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,sweat gland,OK,
2804,"Pinel, L. and Cyr, D.G.","Self-renewal and differentiation of rat epididymal basal cells using a novel in vitro organoid model; 3D cell culture;  basal cells;  epididymis;  organoids;  stem cells; The epididymis is composed of a pseudostratified epithelium that is comprised of various cell types. Studies have shown that rat basal cells share common properties with adult stem cells and begin to differentiate in vitro in response to fibroblast growth factor and 5-dihydrotestosterone. The characterization of rat basal cells is therefore necessary to fully understand the role of these cells. The objectives of this study were to assess the ability of single basal cells to develop organoids and to assess their ability to self-renew and differentiate in vitro. We isolated basal cells from the rat epididymis and established three-dimensional cell cultures from the basal and nonbasal cell fractions. Organoids were formed by single adult epididymal basal cells. Organoids were dissociated into single basal cells, which were able to reform new organoids, and were maintained over 10 generations. Long-term culture of organoids revealed that these cells could be differentiated into cells expressing the principal cell markers aquaporin 9 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Electron microscopy demonstrated that organoids were composed of several polarized cell types displaying microvilli and the ability to form tight junctions. Additionally, organoids could be formed by basal cells from either the proximal or distal region of the epididymis and are able to secrete clusterin, a protein implicated in the maturation of spermatozoa. These data indicate that rat basal cells can be used to derive epididymal organoids and further support that notion that these may represent a stem cell population in the epididymis.  2021 The Author(s) 2021.

METHODOLOGY: Human dental pulp cells (hDPC) and endothelial cells (EC) were mixed with or without human dental pulp derived extracellular matrix (hDP-ECM) according to several protocols and cultured in 3D plates to fabricate 3D organoids. Cell viability and proliferation in organoids were evaluated using Live/Dead cell viability assay and ATPase assay. Organoids were fixed, cut and stained with a H&E staining kit. The expressions of DSPP, DMP-1, CD31, vWF and COL1A in 3D organoids were evaluated using immunofluorescence. To assess the feasibility of 3D organoids on drug/material toxicity screening, the organoids were treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or iRoot BP. Then, cell viability and apoptosis were assessed. The expressions of IL-6, TNF-, and IL-1 were compared in LPS-treated and non-treated organoids. Alizarin Red S staining was used to evaluate calcium deposit formation in organoids. Data were analysed using one-way anova followed by Tukey's post hoc comparison. RESULTS: The 3D spheres/organoids were formed at day 1 or day 2. Cells in 3D organoids maintained a high viability rate and low proliferation activity. The level of CD31 increased significantly (p < .05) when EC were added to coculture with hDPC.

To create a model system of these cartilage-bone interactions, we developed an osteochondral organoid from murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using this approach, we grew organoids from a single cell type through time-dependent sequential exposure of growth factors, namely transforming growth factor -3 and bone morphogenic protein 2, to mirror bone development through endochondral ossification. The result is a cartilaginous region and a calcified bony region comprising an organoid with the potential for joint disease drug screening and investigation of genetic risk in a patient or disease-specific manner. Furthermore, we also investigated the possibility of the differentiated cells within the organoid to revert to a pluripotent state. It was found that while the cells themselves maintain the capacity for reinduction of pluripotency, encapsulation in the newly formed 3D matrix prevents this process from occurring, which could have implications for future clinical use of iPSCs.",formation of osteochondral organoid from murine induced pluripotent stem cells.,"chondrogenic and ipsc and organoid and osteoarthritis and osteogenic and scaffold-free and tissue engineering;  to create a model system of these cartilage-bone interactions, we developed an osteochondral organoid from murine induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs).;  using this approach, we grew organoid from a single cell type through time-dependent sequential exposure of growth factors, namely transforming growth factor -3 and bone morphogenic protein 2, to mirror bone development through endochondral ossification.;  the result is a cartilaginous region and a calcified bony region comprising an organoid with the potential for joint disease drug screening and investigation of genetic risk in a patient or disease-specific manner.;  furthermore, we also investigated the possibility of the differentiated cells within the organoid to revert to a pluripotent state.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",osteochondral,OK,

A scaffold-free three-dimensional (3D) organoid model for in vitro tenogenesis/ligamentogeneis has already been described. As PDL tissue naturally arises from the dental follicle, the aim of this study was to investigate the ligamentogenic differentiation potential of dental follicle cells (DFCs) in vitro by employing this 3D model. Human primary DFCs were compared, in both two-and three-dimensions, to a previously published PDL-hTERT cell line. The 3D organoids were evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and F-actin staining combined with detailed histomorphometric analyses of cell-row structure, angular deviation and cell density. Furthermore, the expression of 48 tendon/ligament-and multilineage-related genes was evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, followed by immunofluorescent analyses of collagen 1 and 3. The results showed that both cell types were successful in the formation of scaffold-free 3D organoids. DFC organoids were comparable to PDL-hTERT in terms of cell density; however, DFCs exhibited superior organoid morphology, cell-row organisation (p < 0.0001) and angular deviation (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, in 2 dimensions as well as in 3D, DFCs showed significantly higher levels of several ligament-related genes compared to the PDL-hTERT cell line. In conclusion, DFCs exhibited great potential to form PDL-like 3D organoids in vitro suggesting that this strategy can be further developed for functional PDL engineering.  2021, AO Research Institute Davos.

The goal of this study was to preclinically explore the application of immunotherapy in treating appendiceal cancer in a personalized organoid model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patient tumor organoids (PTO) were fabricated using unsorted tumor cells with and without enrichment with patient-matched immune components derived from peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, or lymph nodes [immune-enhanced PTOs (iPTO)]. Organoids were cultured for 7 days, followed by treatment with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab), and assessed for treatment efficacy. RESULTS: Between September 2019 and May 2021, 26 patients were enrolled in the study.

Safer alternative methods to produce venom would facilitate the production of both antivenom and novel therapeutics.

Snake venom gland organoids are 3D culture models that can be derived within days from embryonic or adult venom gland tissues from several snake species and can be maintained long-term (we have cultured some organoids for more than 2 years). We have successfully used the protocol with glands from late-stage embryos and recently deceased adult snakes. The cellular heterogeneity of the venom gland is maintained in the organoids, and cell type composition can be controlled through changes in media composition. We describe in detail how to derive and grow the organoids, how to dissociate them into single cells, and how to cryopreserve and differentiate them into toxin-producing organoids.

Lack of disease-specific in-vitro models of NPC, together with difficulties in establishing patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, have further hindered development of personalized therapeutic options. Herein, we established two NPC organoid lines from recurrent NPC PDX models and further characterized and compared these models with original patient tumors using RNA sequencing analysis. Organoids were cultured in hypoxic conditions to examine the effects of hypoxia and radioresistance. These models were then utilized to determine the radiobiological parameters, such as alpha/beta ratio and oxygen enhancement ratio (OER), characteristic to radiosensitive normoxic and radioresistant hypoxic NPC, using simple dose-survival data analytic tools. The results were further validated in-vitro and in-vivo, to determine the optimal boost dose and fractionation regimen required to achieve effective NPC tumor regression. Despite the differences in tumor microenvironment due to the lack of human stroma, RNA sequencing analysis revealed good correlation of NPC PDX and organoid models with patient tumors. Additionally, the established models also mimicked inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Hypoxic NPC organoids were highly radioresistant and had high alpha/beta ratio compared to its normoxic counterparts. In-vitro and in-vivo fractionation studies showed that hypoxic NPC was less sensitive to RT fractionation scheme and required a large bolus dose or 1.4 times of the fractionated dose that was effective against normoxic cells in order to compensate for oxygen deficiency. This study is the first direct experimental evidence to predict optimal RT boost dose required to cause sufficient damage to recurrent hypoxic NPC tumor cells, which can be further used to develop dose-painting algorithms in clinical practice.

To improve the printability of the bio-ink, we first investigated the digestion process of the powdered dECM material obtained from porcine tendons. We manifested the digestion process of tendon derived dECM powders, which includes dissolution, gelatinization and solubilization. After a short dissolution period (around 10 min), we observed a 'High viscosity slurry' status (3 h) of the dECM precursors, i.e. the gelatinization process, followed by the solubilization processes, i.e. a 'Medium viscosity slurry' period (12 h) and a 'Low viscosity slurry' period (72 h). The 'Medium viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink was inhomogeneous and could not be extruded out from the barrel after the pH value was neutralized to 7.4. Although the 'Low viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink has been reported to be extrudable, it has poor printability. This study explores the printability of the 'High viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink, which has not been addressed thus far. The results demonstrate that this less digested status of the dECM bio-ink yields higher shape fidelity and stacking accuracy than the traditional over-digested status of the dECM bio-ink; this indicates better printability of this less digested dECM bio-ink. We compared the performance of the two bio-inks using cell viability tests for 3D cell printing. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived from rats was printed using the 'High viscosity slurry' status of the dECM bio-ink, yielding high cellular viability lasting for 7 d after printing. Thus, the 'High viscosity slurry' status of tendon dECM bio-ink can be utilized to fabricate complicated 3D organoid structures; it also shows promise for applications such as regenerative medicine and biomimetic tissue engineering.  2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",NA,"na;  thus, the 'high viscosity slurry' status of tendon decm bio-ink can be utilized to fabricate complicated 3d organoid structures; it also shows promise for applications such as regenerative medicine and biomimetic tissue engineering.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",tendon,unidentified,unidentified

Previous genetic studies have revealed genes that are critical for the development of tracheal cartilage. However, it is still unclear how crosstalk between these proteins regulates tracheal cartilage formation. Here we show a core regulatory network underlying murine tracheal chondrogenesis from embryonic day (E) 12.5 to E15.5, by combining volumetric imaging of fluorescence reporters, inhibitor assays, and mathematical modeling. We focused on SRY-box transcription factor 9 (Sox9) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the tracheal mesenchyme, and observed a synchronous, inverted U-shaped temporal change in both Sox9 expression and ERK activity with a peak at E14.5, whereas the expression level of downstream cartilage matrix genes, such as collagen II alpha 1 (Col2a1) and aggrecan (Agc1), monotonically increased. Inhibitor assays revealed that the ERK signaling pathway functions as an inhibitory regulator of tracheal cartilage differentiation during this period. These results suggest that expression of the cartilage matrix genes is controlled by an incoherent feedforward loop via Sox9 and ERK, which is supported by a mathematical model. Furthermore, the modeling analysis suggests that a Sox9-ERK incoherent feedforward regulation augments the robustness against the variation of upstream factors. The present study provides a better understanding of the regulatory network underlying the tracheal development and will be helpful for efficient induction of tracheal organoids.

This innovative in vitro model is highly relevant to study physiology of the intestinal epithelium and its role in nutrition and barrier function. However, this model has never been developed in rabbits, while it would have potential applications for biomedical and veterinary research. Here, we cultured rabbit caecum organoids with either pharmacological inhibitors (2Ki medium) or L-WRN cells conditioned medium (L-WRN CM) to reconstitute the intestinal stem cell niche in vitro. Large spherical organoids were obtained with the 2Ki medium and this morphology was associated with a high level of proliferation and stem cells markers gene expression. In contrast, organoids cultured with L-WRN CM had a smaller diameter; a greater cell height and part of them were not spherical. When the L-WRN CM was used at low concentration (5%) for two days, the gene expression of stem cells and proliferation markers were very low, while absorptive and secretory cells markers and antimicrobial peptides were elevated. Epithelial cells within organoids were polarized in 3D cultures with 2Ki medium or L-WRN CM (apical side towards the lumen). We cultured dissociated organoid cells in 2D monolayers, which allowed accessibility to the apical compartment. Under these conditions, actin stress fibers were observed with the 2Ki medium, while perijonctionnal localization of actin was observed with the L-WRN CM suggesting, in 2D cultures as well, a higher differentiation level in the presence of L-WRN CM. In conclusion, rabbit caecum organoids cultured with the 2Ki medium were more proliferative and less differentiated than organoids cultured with L-WRN CM. We propose that organoids cultured with the 2Ki medium could be used to rapidly generate in vitro a large number of rabbit intestinal epithelial stem cells while organoids cultured with the L-WRN CM used at low concentration represent a suitable model to study differentiated rabbit epithelium.",culture of rabbit caecum organoid by reconstituting the intestinal stem cell niche in vitro with pharmacological inhibitors or l-wrn conditioned medium,"na; intestinal organoid are self-organized 3-dimensional (3d) structures formed by a single layer of polarized epithelial cells.;  here, we cultured rabbit caecum organoid with either pharmacological inhibitors (2ki medium) or l-wrn cells conditioned medium (l-wrn cm) to reconstitute the intestinal stem cell niche in vitro.;  large spherical organoid were obtained with the 2ki medium and this morphology was associated with a high level of proliferation and stem cells markers gene expression.;  in contrast, organoid cultured with l-wrn cm had a smaller diameter; a greater cell height and part of them were not spherical.;  epithelial cells within organoid were polarized in 3d cultures with 2ki medium or l-wrn cm (apical side towards the lumen).;  we cultured dissociated organoid cells in 2d monolayers, which allowed accessibility to the apical compartment.;  in conclusion, rabbit caecum organoid cultured with the 2ki medium were more proliferative and less differentiated than organoid cultured with l-wrn cm.;  we propose that organoid cultured with the 2ki medium could be used to rapidly generate in vitro a large number of rabbit intestinal epithelial stem cells while organoid cultured with the l-wrn cm used at low concentration represent a suitable model to study differentiated rabbit epithelium.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",caecum,OK,

Most men with cystic fibrosis (CF) are infertile due to defects in the epididymis and vas deferens; however, the causative mechanisms are still unclear. We used human epididymis epithelial cell (HEE) organoids and polarized HEE cell cultures to assay the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the human epididymis. 3D HEE organoids and polarized 2D HEE cell cultures on membrane inserts were established from human caput epididymis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to map cell type-specific gene expression in the organoids. Using forskolin (FSK) to activate CFTR and inhibitor CFTRinh(172) to block its activity, we assessed how CFTR contributes to organoid swelling and epithelial barrier function. The scRNA-seq data showed key caput epididymis cell types present in HEE organoid cultures. FSK at 10 M induced HEE organoid swelling by 20% at 16 h, while 5 and 10 M CFTRinh(172) treatment significantly reduced HEE organoid size. In transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements, FSK reduced TER, while inhibition of CFTR increased TER; also, depletion of CFTR with specific siRNAs significantly increased TER. FSK treatment significantly increased the flux of 4-kDa but not 70-kDa dextran, suggesting activation of CFTR mainly enhances transcellular diffusion.

Exposure to EDs has also been associated with impairment of the reproductive system and incidence in occurrence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases during ageing. SCREENED aims at developing in vitro assays based on rodent and human thyroid cells organized in three different three-dimensional (3D) constructs. Due to different levels of anatomical complexity, each of these constructs has the potential to increasingly mimic the structure and function of the native thyroid gland, ultimately achieving relevant features of its 3D organization including: 1) a 3D organoid based on stem cell-derived thyrocytes, 2) a 3D organoid based on a decellularized thyroid lobe stromal matrix repopulated with stem cell-derived thyrocytes, and 3) a bioprinted organoid based on stem cell-derived thyrocytes able to mimic the spatial and geometrical features of a native thyroid gland. These 3D constructs will be hosted in a modular microbioreactor equipped with innovative sensing technology and enabling precise control of cell culture conditions. New superparamagnetic biocompatible and biomimetic particles will be used to produce ""magnetic cells"" to support precise spatiotemporal homing of the cells in the 3D decellularized and bioprinted constructs. Finally, these 3D constructs will be used to screen the effect of EDs on the thyroid function in a unique biological sex-specific manner. Their performance will be assessed individually, in comparison with each other, and against in vivo studies. The resulting 3D assays are expected to yield responses to low doses of different EDs, with sensitivity and specificity higher than that of classical 2D in vitro assays and animal models. Supporting the ""Adverse Outcome Pathway"" concept, proteogenomic analysis and biological computational modelling of the underlying mode of action of the tested EDs will be pursued to gain a mechanistic understanding of the chain of events from exposure to adverse toxic effects on thyroid function. For future uptake, SCREENED will engage discussion with relevant stakeholder groups, including regulatory bodies and industry, to ensure that the assays will fit with purposes of ED safety assessment.

Yet the spleen has demonstrable regenerative capacity and cells might be recovered and reimplanted at the time of injury or excision to avoid these risks. Methods: Tissue-engineered spleen (TESp) was generated from Actin(GFP) mice (mTESp) or human donor spleen (hTESp) through implantation of spleen organoid units (spleen OU), in NOD/SCID mice with concurrent splenectomy, on a biodegradable scaffold. Explants were evaluated and blood smears were obtained to investigate the presence of target cells or Howell-Jolly bodies, which are erythrocyte sequelae of asplenia. Results: TESp was generated from mouse (mTESp) and human (hTESp) donor cells with essential splenic components: red and white pulp with trabeculae. mTESp and hTESp demonstrated green fluorescent protein- or lamin-positive costaining with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, CD4, and CD11c, identifying proliferative donor cells and key immune components of the spleen of donor origin. Animals with hTESp and mTESP combined with splenectomy had significantly fewer Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smears than controls. Conclusion: TESp from mouse and human donor cells can be generated by 4 weeks and contains donor immune cells identified by CD4 and CD11c. TESp reduces postsplenectomy erythrocyte inclusions, indicating possible function. Impact Statement Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection is rare but highly mortal. Tissue-engineered spleen (TESp) was generated from murine (mTESp) and human (hTESp) donors and appeared histologically similar to native spleen. Both mTESp and hTESp demonstrated proliferative cells of donor spleen origin. Importantly, functional cells were demonstrated on imaging with a corresponding reduction in the number of erythrocyte inclusions in blood smears that are typically identified in patients with asplenia and indicate a lack of clearance by functional spleen tissue.

Tissue engineered artificial substitutes could represent a promising approach to tackle this challenge. In our current study, tissue-engineered trachea, based on a 3D-printed poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffold with similar morphology to the native trachea of rabbits, was used for segmental tracheal reconstruction. The 3D-printed scaffolds were seeded with chondrocytes obtained from autologous auricula, dynamically pre-cultured in vitro for 2weeks, and pre-vascularized in vivo for another 2weeks to generate an integrated segmental trachea organoid unit. Then, segmental tracheal defects in rabbits were restored by transplanting the engineered tracheal substitute with pedicled muscular flaps. We found that the combination of in vitro pre-culture and in vivo pre-vascularization successfully generated a segmental tracheal substitute with bionic structure and mechanical properties similar to the native trachea of rabbits. Moreover, the stable blood supply provided by the pedicled muscular flaps facilitated the survival of chondrocytes and accelerated epithelialization, thereby improving the survival rate.

Appropriate testing of these materials requires a platform that mimics the in vivo environment and allows the architectural self-assembly of cells into tissue constructs. In this study, we employ a new 3D model to assess the impact of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) on early organization and advanced recruitment/accumulation of immortalized mouse gingival fibroblasts (GFs) and dental papilla mesenchymal cells (DPMCs) in extracellular matrix. We hypothesize that TEGDMA (1) interferes with the developmental architecture of GFs and DPMCs, and (2) inhibits the deposition of mineral. To test these hypotheses, GFs and DPMCs were incubated with the soluble TEGDMA at concentrations (0-2.5) mmol/L. Diameter and thickness of the constructs were determined by microscopic analysis. Cell differentiation was assessed by immunocytochemistry and the secreted mineral detected by alizarin-red staining. TEGDMA interfered with the development of GFs and/or DPMCs microtissues in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting growth of inter-spherical cell layers and decreasing spheroid size (four to six times). At low/moderate TEGDMA levels, GFs organoids retained their structures while reducing thickness up to 21%. In contrast, at low TEGDMA doses, architecture of DPMC organoids was altered and thickness decreased almost twofold. Overall, developmental ability of TEGDMA-exposed GFs and DPMCs depended on TEGDMA level. GFs constructs were more resistant to structural modifications.

Loss of TFF1 expression in the TFF1-knockout (KO) mouse leads to a pro-inflammatory phenotype with a cascade of gastric lesions that include low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinomas. In this study, we demonstrate nuclear localization of p-STAT(Y705), with significant overexpression of several STAT3 target genes in gastric glands from the TFF1-KO mice. We also show frequent loss of TFF1 with nuclear localization of STAT3 in human gastric cancers.

Here we used Escherichia coli and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) resistance as a model to understand how the artificial environments utilized in studies of bacterial fitness could affect the emergence of resistance and associated fitness costs. Further, we explored the predictive value of this data when strains were grown in the more physiologically relevant environments of urine and urothelial organoids. Resistant E. coli isolates were selected for following 24-h exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of AMC in either M9, ISO, or LB, followed by growth on LB agar containing AMC. No resistant colonies emerged following growth in M9, whereas resistant isolates were detected from cultures grown in ISO and LB. We observed both within and between media-type variability in the levels of resistance and fitness of the resistant mutants grown in LB. MICs and fitness of these resistant strains in different media (M9, ISO, LB, human urine, and urothelial organoids) showed considerable variation. Media can therefore have a direct effect on the isolation of mutants that confer resistance to AMC and these mutants can exhibit unpredictable MIC and fitness profiles under different growth conditions.

We utilized in vitro assays, 3D gastric gland organoid cultures, mouse models, and human tissue samples to investigate the biological and molecular impact of DARPP-32 on activation of IGF1R and STAT3 signaling and gastric tumorigenesis. DARPP-32 enhanced phosphorylation of IGF1R (Y1135), a step that was critical for STAT3 phosphorylation at Y705, nuclear localization, and transcription activation. By using proximity ligation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that IGF1R and DARPP-32 co-existed in the same protein complex. Binding of DARPP-32 to IGF1R promoted IGF1R phosphorylation with subsequent activation of downstream SRC and STAT3. Analysis of gastric tissues from the TFF1 knockout (KO) mouse model of gastric neoplasia, demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT3 in the early stages of gastric tumorigenesis.

In this study, scaffold-free tissue constructs engineered using periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs), which contain a population of adult stem/progenitor cells, self-assembled into an organized multi-tissue structure comprising a mineralized cementum-like core enclosed within a periodontal ligament (PDL)-like tissue. Scaffold-free engineered constructs were formed by culturing human PDLCs to form a cell sheet on six-well dishes containing two minutien pins placed 7 mm apart. The cell sheet was contracted by the cells to roll into the pins forming a cylindrical construct anchored on either end by the pins. These tissues were approximately 1 mm in diameter and 7 mm long and contained only the cells and their endogenous matrix. These scaffold-free engineered constructs exhibited two structurally distinct tissues, one in the center of the construct and another on the periphery. The center tissue was mineralized and expressed alkaline phosphatase and bone sialoprotein, similar to cementum. The peripheral tissue was not calcified and expressed periodontal ligament-associated protein-1 and periostin, which is characteristic of the periodontal ligament. This tissue organization was seen after in vitro culture and maintained in vivo following subcutaneous implantation in immunocompromised mice. These data demonstrate that scaffold-free tissue engineering facilitates PDLCs to self-assemble into an organized cementum-PDL-like complex.

METHODS: Appendiceal cancer specimens obtained during cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy procedures (CRS/HIPEC) were dissociated and incorporated into an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel system as three-dimensional (3D), patient-specific tumor organoids. Cells were not sorted, preserving tumor heterogeneity, including stroma and immune cell components. Following establishment of organoid sets, chemotherapy drugs were screened in parallel. Live/dead staining and quantitative metabolism assays recorded which chemotherapies were most effective in killing cancer cells for a specific patient. Maintenance of cancer phenotypes were confirmed by using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Biospecimens from 12 patients were applied for organoid development between November 2016 and May 2018. Successful establishment rate of viable organoid sets was 75% (9/12). Average time from organoid development to chemotherapy testing was 7 days.

5947,Broda TR and McCracken KW and Wells JM,"Generation of human antral and fundic gastric organoids from pluripotent stem cells.; NA; The human stomach contains two primary domains: the corpus, which contains the fundic epithelium, and the antrum. Each of these domains has distinct cell types and functions, and therefore each presents with unique disease pathologies. Here, we detail two protocols to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into human gastric organoids (hGOs) that recapitulate both domains. Both protocols begin with the differentiation of hPSCs into definitive endoderm (DE) using activin A, followed by the generation of free-floating 3D posterior foregut spheroids using FGF4, Wnt pathway agonist CHIR99021 (CHIR), BMP pathway antagonist Noggin, and retinoic acid. Embedding spheroids in Matrigel and continuing 3D growth in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-containing medium for 4 weeks results in antral hGOs (hAGOs). To obtain fundic hGOs (hFGOs), spheroids are additionally treated with CHIR and FGF10.

Like other skin components, they originate from epidermal progenitors. However, they have low regenerative potential in response to injury. We have established a sweat gland culture and expansion method using 3D organoids cultures. The epithelial cells derived from sweat glands in dermis of adult mouse paw pads were embedded into Matrigel and formed sweat gland organoids (SGOs). These organoids maintained remarkable stem cell features and demonstrated differentiation capacity to give rise to either sweat gland cells (SGCs) or epidermal cells. Moreover, the bipotent SGO-derived cells could be induced into stratified epidermis structures at the air-liquid interface culture in a medium tailored for skin epidermal cells in vitro. The SGCs embedded in Matrigel tailored for sweat glands formed epithelial organoids, which expressed sweat-gland-specific markers, such as cytokeratin (CK) 18 and CK19, aquaporin (AQP) 5 and ATP. More importantly, they had potential of regeneration of epidermis and sweat gland when they were transplanted into the mouse back wound and claw pad with sweat gland injury, respectively. In summary, we established and optimized culture conditions for effective generation of mouse SGOs.

They have no effective therapeutic options. Tools to study EHBD are very limited. Our purpose was to develop an organ-specific, versatile, adult stem cell-derived, preclinical cholangiocyte model that can be easily generated from wild type and genetically engineered mice. Thus, we report on the novel technique of developing an EHBD organoid (EHBDO) culture system from adult mouse EHBDs. The model is cost-efficient, able to be readily analyzed, and has multiple downstream applications. Specifically, we describe the methodology of mouse EHBD isolation and single cell dissociation, organoid culture initiation, propagation, and long-term maintenance and storage. This manuscript also describes EHBDO processing for immunohistochemistry, fluorescent microscopy, and mRNA abundance quantitation by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). This protocol has significant advantages in addition to producing EHBD-specific organoids. The use of a conditioned medium from L-WRN cells significantly reduces the cost of this model. The use of mouse EHBDs provides almost unlimited tissue for culture generation, unlike human tissue. Generated mouse EHBDOs contain a pure population of epithelial cells with markers of endodermal progenitor and differentiated biliary cells. Cultured organoids maintain homogenous morphology through multiple passages and can be recovered after a long-term storage period in liquid nitrogen. The model allows for the study of biliary progenitor cell proliferation, can be manipulated pharmacologically, and may be generated from genetically engineered mice. Future studies are needed to optimize culture conditions in order to increase plating efficiency, evaluate functional cell maturity, and direct cell differentiation.

It is clear that this robust regulation requires cells to sense and modulate 3D tissue formation across different scales, but its underlying mechanisms are still unclear. To address this question, we developed a versatile computational model of 3D multicellular dynamics at single-cell resolution and combined it with the 3D culture system of pluripotent stem cell-derived optic-cup organoid.

While they have been proposed to play a role in the regeneration of both acute and chronic TM perforations, evidence for the mechanism and regulation of their contribution is not yet described. Indeed, the behavior of these putative stem cells is largely unknown, in part due to a lack of refined methods for efficient cell isolation. In this study, we compared different explant techniques using normal and perforated rat TM tissues and investigated their ex vivo characteristics. TM after perforation in vivo showed increased staining for epidermal stem cell markers integrin 1 and cytokeratin (CK) 19, and for proliferation Ki-67, indicating activation of the proliferative centers. A mixed population of fibroblasts and epithelial cells were isolated from explant cultures. Excised TM umbo implanted on a culture well insert was the most effective technique. Explants made from perforated TM produced cells before those from unperforated TM. More importantly, the implanted TM umbo organoid was capable of producing cells in a continuous manner, allowing subsequent harvest using trypsin. Primary rat TM epithelial cell cultures positive for pancytokeratin had colony forming activity and could be enriched for CK 19-positive cells that were capable of culture expansion by proliferation and cell migration when subject to a wound assay.

Despite the term carcinoid, neuroendocrine features are inconspicuous, and its behavior is distinct from carcinoid. Its high-grade counterpart is designated as adenocarcinoma ex GCC. We conducted a retrospective study of 105 tumors to find prognostic values of a variety of clinicopathologic features. The tumors were subclassified as low grade, equivalent to classic type, and high grade, defined as loss of organoid pattern, and a proportion (%) of low and high grades were documented in each tumor. Correlations between survival and various clinicopathologic parameters were investigated. One-third were pure low grade, while the remainder contained variable high-grade component ranging from 5% to 95%. Neuroendocrine cell component ranged from 0% to 90% (median, 5), while mucus cell component ranged from 5% to 100% (median, 70). By univariate analysis, size, stage, high-grade component, nuclear grade, surgery, and chemotherapy correlated with cancer-related survival (CSS), and by multivariate analysis, stage (P =.001), high-grade component (P =.008), and tumor size (P =.005) correlated with CSS. There was significant difference in CSS when the cases were grouped by high-grade component: <40%, 40% to 90%, and <=90% (P <.001). Our results indicate that staging and proportion of high-grade histology may provide important prognostic information. Neuroendocrine component was insignificant in both low- and high-grade areas.

We tested the feasibility of using this DPS model for drug screening by using minoxidil, which is a standard drug for androgenic alopecia. Minoxidil-treated DPS showed enhanced expression of growth factors and ECM proteins. Further, an attempt has been made to establish an in vitro 3D organoid model consisting of DPS encapsulated by SG hydrogel and hair follicle (HF) keratinocytes and stem cells.

Here, we present a simple three-dimensional model system based on micro-dissecting the rat tympanic membrane umbo and grafting it into the membrane of a cell culture well insert. Cell outgrowth from the graft produced sufficient cells to populate a membrane of similar surface area to the human tympanic membrane within 2 weeks. Tissue grafts from the annulus region also showed cell outgrowth but were not as productive. The umbo organoid supported substantial cell proliferation and migration under the influence of keratinocyte growth medium. Cells from umbo grafts were enzymatically harvested from the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane for expansion in routine culture and cells could be harvested consecutively from the same graft over multiple cycles. We used harvested cells to test cell migration properties and to engraft a porous silk scaffold material as proof-of-principle for tissue engineering applications.

Promoting effective immunosurveillance by leukocytes that scan for nascent neoplastic transformations represents a potential means to achieve this goal. Because most breast cancers arise within the ductal epithelium, enhancing protective immunosurveillance will likely necessitate targeting one or more of the distinctive lymphocyte types found in these sites under normal conditions. Here, we have characterized the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment of non-cancerous human breast tissue and identified a subset of T lymphocytes that can be pharmacologically targeted to enhance their responses to breast cancer cells. Specifically, V2(+)  T cells were consistently present in preparations of mammary ductal epithelial organoids and they proliferated in response to zoledronic acid, an aminobisphosphonate drug. V2(+) T cells from breast ductal organoids produced the antitumor cytokine IFN and efficiently killed bisphosphonate-pulsed breast carcinoma cells.

To identify signals controlling basal cell behavior we screened factors that alter their self-renewal and differentiation in a clonal organoid (tracheosphere) assay. This revealed that inhibitors of the canonical BMP signaling pathway promote proliferation but do not affect lineage choice, whereas exogenous Bmp4 inhibits proliferation and differentiation. We therefore followed changes in BMP pathway components in vivo in the mouse trachea during epithelial regeneration from basal cells after injury. The findings suggest that BMP signaling normally constrains proliferation at steady state and this brake is released transiently during repair by the upregulation of endogenous BMP antagonists. Early in repair, the packing of epithelial cells along the basal lamina increases, but density is later restored by active extrusion of apoptotic cells. Systemic administration of the BMP antagonist LDN-193189 during repair initially increases epithelial cell number but, following the shedding phase, normal density is restored.

CagA translocates into the cytoplasm where it stimulates cell signaling through the interaction with tyrosine kinase c-Met receptor, leading cellular proliferation. Identified as a potential gastric stem cell marker, cluster-of-differentiation (CD) CD44 also acts as a co-receptor for c-Met, but whether it plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial proliferation is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that CD44 plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation. To assay changes in gastric epithelial cell proliferation in relation to the direct interaction with H. pylori, human- and mouse-derived gastric organoids were infected with the G27 H. pylori strain or a mutant G27 strain bearing cagA deletion (CagA::cat).

The mechanism by which H. pylori induces Shh is unknown. Shh is a target gene of transcription factor Nuclear Factor-B (NFB). We hypothesize that NFB mediates H. pylori-induced Shh. Materials and Methods: To visualize Shh ligand expression in response to H. pylori infection in vivo, we used a mouse model that expresses Shh fused to green fluorescent protein (Shh::GFP mice) in place of wild-type Shh. In vitro, changes in Shh expression were measured in response to H. pylori infection using 3-dimensional epithelial cell cultures grown from whole dissociated gastric glands (organoids). Organoids were generated from stomachs collected from the fundic region of control and mice expressing a parietal cell-specific deletion of Shh (PC-ShhKO mice). Results: Within 2 days of infection, H. pylori induced Shh expression within parietal cells of Shh::GFP mice. Organoids expressed all major gastric cell markers, including parietal cell marker H+,K+-ATPase and Shh.

The hair follicle is an organoid that has been much studied based on its ability to grow quickly and to regenerate after trauma. But hair follicle formation in vitro has been elusive. Replacing hair lost due to pattern baldness or more severe alopecia, including that induced by chemotherapy, remains a significant unmet medical need. By carefully analyzing and recapitulating the growth conditions of hair follicle formation, we recreated human hair follicles in tissue culture that were capable of producing hair. Our microfollicles contained all relevant cell types and their structure and orientation resembled in some ways excised hair follicle specimens from human skin. This finding offers a new window onto hair follicle development.

Current therapies for DED do not fully replenish the necessary lubrication to rescue optimal vision. New drug discovery for DED has been limited perhaps because in vitro models cannot mimic the biology of the native LG. The existing platforms for LG organoid culture are scarce and still not ready for consistency and scale up production towards drug screening. The magnetic three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting (M3DB) is a novel system for 3D in vitro biofabrication of cellularized tissues using magnetic nanoparticles to bring cells together. M3DB provides a scalable platform for consistent handling of spheroid-like cell cultures facilitating consistent biofabrication of organoids. Previously, we successfully generated innervated secretory epithelial organoids from human dental pulp stem cells with M3DB and found that this platform is feasible for epithelial organoid bioprinting. Research targeting LG organogenesis, drug discovery for DED has extensively used mouse models. However, certain inter-species differences between mouse and human must be considered. Porcine LG appear to have more similarities to human LG than the mouse counterparts.

This dynamic system could serve as a model for the study of a variety of different phenomena involving exocrine gland activation, protein synthesis, stabilization of protein products and secretory mechanisms. However, these studies have been hampered by a lack of a long-term model that can be propagated in the lab (as opposed to whole-animal studies). Numerous attempts have been made to extend the lifetime of venom gland secretory cells, but only recently has an organoid model been shown to have the requisite qualities of recapitulation of the native system, self-propagation and long-term viability (>1year). A tractable model is now available for myriad cell- and molecular-level studies of venom glands, protein synthesis and secretion.

Evidence from domestic species demonstrates that the placenta is capable of stimulating its own development through a signalling dialogue with the endometrial glands. Placental lactogens produced by the trophoblast lead to increased expression and release of uterine secretions and mitogenic growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, that have a close temporal and spatial relationship with trophoblast proliferation. Here, we review evidence that an equivalent mechanism operates in the human. The same repertoire of receptors is present on the endometrial gland cells, and the epithelial cells have long been known to adopt a hypersecretory phenotype following an implantation. Furthermore, early pregnancy hormones stimulate the secretion of glycodelin-A and osteopontin, two 'uterine milk proteins' that have multiple potential effects at the maternal-placental interface, from organoid cultures derived from endometrial glands. Prolactin appears to be an important stimulant, but unlike in domestic species the human trophoblast does not secrete this hormone. Instead, it is a major product of decidual cells. Hence, complications of pregnancy that have their pathophysiological roots in deficient trophoblast proliferation may be due primarily to problems of decidualisation. Ensuring the endometrium is in an optimal state pre-conceptionally should therefore be a priority for women's health. Trophoblast stemness and proliferative capacity show a sharp decline at the switch from histotrophic to haemotrophic nutrition. This may reflect the increase in oxygen concentration or loss of growth factor support.

One of themost remarkable examples in nature of convergent evolutionary novelty is animal venom. Across diverse animal phyla, various specialized organs and anatomical structures have evolved from disparate developmental tissues to perform the same function, that is, produce and deliver a cocktail of potent molecules to subdue prey or predators. Venomous organisms therefore offer unique opportunities to investigate the evolutionary processes of convergence of key adaptive traits, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of novel genes, cells, and tissues. Indeed, some venomous species have already proven to be highly amenable as models for developmental studies, and recent work with venom gland organoids provides manipulatable systems for directly testing important evolutionary questions. Here, we provide a synthesis of the current knowledge that could serve as a starting point for the establishment of venom systems as new models for evolutionary and molecular biology. In particular, we highlight the potential of various venomous species for the study of cell differentiation and cell identity, and the regulatory dynamics of rapidly evolving, highly expressed, tissue-specific, gene paralogs.

9351,Pinel L and Mandon M and Cyr DG,"Tissue regeneration and the epididymal stem cell.; basal cell and development and stem cell; BACKGROUND: In most pseudostratified epithelia, basal cells represent a multipotent adult stem cell population. These cells generally remain in a quiescent state, until they are stimulated to respond to tissue damage by initiating epithelial regeneration. In the epididymis, cell proliferation occurs at a relatively slow rate under normal physiological conditions. Epididymal basal cells have been shown to share common properties with multipotent adult stem cells. The development of organoids from stem cells represents a novel approach for understanding cellular differentiation and characterization of stem cells. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on tissue regeneration in the epididymis and demonstrate the presence of an epididymal stem cell population. METHODS: PubMed database was searched for studies reporting on cell proliferation, regeneration, and stem cells in the epididymis. Three-dimensional cell culture of epididymal cells was used to determine whether these can develop into organoids in a similar fashion to stem cells from other tissues. RESULTS: The epididymal epithelium can rapidly regenerate following orchidectomy or efferent duct ligation, in order to maintain epithelial integrity. Studies have isolated a highly purified fraction of rat epididymal basal cells and reported that these cells displayed properties similar to those of multipotent adult stem cells. In two-dimensional cell culture conditions, these cells differentiated into cells which expressed connexin 26, a marker of columnar cells, and cytokeratin 8. Furthermore, three-dimensional cell culture of epididymal cells resulted in the formation of organoids, a phenomenon associated with the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in vitro.

To verify the frequency, the anatomical localization and the phenotype of misplaced endometrial tissue along the fetal female reproductive tract, histological and immunohistochemical analyses of uteri, fallopian tubes, and uterosacral ligaments were performed. Method(s): Reproductive organs were collected from seven female fetuses at autopsy, five of them from gestational ages between 18 and 26 weeks and two fetuses with gestational ages of 33 and 36 weeks deceased of placental anomalies. Serial sections from areas containing ectopic glands and embryonic duct residues were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical procedures. Result(s): Numerous ectopic endometrial glands and stroma were detected in the myometrium in two fetuses with low levels of expression of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and progesterone receptors (PR). The embryonic ducts were localized in the uterine broad and ovarian ligaments and under the fallopian tube serosa in six fetuses. Low levels of steroid receptors expression were found in the embryonic residues, whereas the carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and the tumor marker Ca 125 were not detected.

During tendon aging and degeneration, tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) experience profound phenotypic changes with declined cellular functions that can be linked to the known increase in complications during tendon healing process in elderly patients. Tissue engineering is a promising approach for achieving a complete recovery of injured tendons. However, use of autologous cells from aged individuals would require restoring the cellular fitness prior to implantation. In this study, we applied an established cell sheet model for in vitro tenogenesis and compared the sheet formation of TSPC derived from young/healthy (Y-TSPCs) versus aged/degenerative (A-TSPCs) human Achilles tendon biopsies with the purpose to unravel differences in their potential to form self-assembled three-dimensional (3D) tendon organoids. Using our three-step protocol, 4 donors of Y-TSPCs and 9 donors of A-TSPCs were subjected to cell sheet formation and maturation in a period of 5 weeks. The sheets were then cross evaluated by weight and diameter measurements; quantification of cell density, proliferation, senescence and apoptosis; histomorphometry; gene expression of 48 target genes; and collagen type I protein production. The results revealed very obvious and significant phenotype in A-TSPC sheets characterized by being fragile and thin with poor tissue morphology, and significantly lower cell density and proliferation, but significantly higher levels of the senescence-related gene markers and apoptotic cells.

Here, we show with nasopharyngeal conditionally reprogrammed cells cultured at the air-liquid interface that pseudostratified epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection. Donors varied in susceptibility to de novo EBV infection, but susceptible cultures also displayed differences with respect to pathogenesis. The cultures from one donor yielded lytic infection but cells from two other donors were positive for EBV-encoded EBERs and negative for other lytic infection markers. All cultures stained positive for the pseudostratified markers CK7, MUC5AC, alpha-tubulin in cilia, and the EBV epithelial cell receptor Ephrin receptor A2. To define EBV transcriptional programs by cell type and to elucidate latent/lytic infection-differential changes, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on one EBV-infected culture that resulted in alignment with many EBV transcripts. EBV transcripts represented a small portion of the total transcriptome (similar to 0.17\%). All cell types in the pseudostratified epithelium had detectable EBV transcripts with suprabasal cells showing the highest number of reads aligning to many EBV genes. Several restriction factors (IRF1, MX1, STAT1, C18orf25) known to limit lytic infection were expressed at lower levels in the lytic subcluster. A third of the differentially-expressed genes in NPC tumors compared to an uninfected pseudostratified ALI culture overlapped with the differentially-expressed genes in the latent subcluster. A third of these commonly perturbed genes were specific to EBV infection and changed in the same direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that the pseudostratified epithelium could harbor EBV infection and that the pseudostratified infection model mirrors many of the transcriptional changes imposed by EBV infection in NPC. Author summary It has been known for over 50 years that EBV latent infection is associated with NPC. Despite many advances from studies in 2-dimensional cell culture, many aspects of EBV molecular pathogenesis in the nasopharynx remain undefined because the cell types and the biology of the nasopharyngeal epithelium can only be faithfully captured in 3-dimensional cell culture. In the stratified epithelium, cellular differentiation triggers lytic infection but it is not clear to what degree the pseudostratified epithelium is involved. The pseudostratified epithelium is abundant in the lateral wall where the lymphoid-rich fossa of Rosenmuller is located and is a site where NPC tumors most often arises. While the oral epithelium is a site of EBV replication, whether the nasopharyngeal epithelium is a major source of EBV shedding in the nasopharynx is not well defined. Here, we present a 3-dimensional organoid model of the nasopharyngeal pseudostratified epithelium showing that such cells can be infected with EBV in some donor cultures, with examples of both latent and lytic infection. We propose that the cell types of the pseudostratified epithelium should be considered a component of EBV pathogenesis in the nasopharynx and that the difference in donor susceptibility and latent/lytic infection could influence EBV's fitness in the nasopharynx.",NA,"na;  here, we present a 3-dimensional organoid model of the nasopharyngeal pseudostratified epithelium showing that such cells can be infected with ebv in some donor cultures, with examples of both latent and lytic infection.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",nasopharynx,OK,

However, the current in vitro cell culture settings for corneal epithelial cells lack the dynamic flow conditions to recapitulate shear stress of eye blinking, hindering corneal function evaluation. We developed a microfluidic platform enabling the dynamic culture of the human corneal barrier with recapitulation of eye blinking. The device consisted of upper and lower channels separated by a porous membrane. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T) were seeded on a porous membrane in an upper channel and cultured for ten days. The cells formed a barrier with high expression of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) tight junction protein on day seven, and the translocation of fluorescein sodium across the barrier in the microfluidic device was comparable to that in the transwell system. Then, bidirectional and unidirectional flows were applied in the upper and lower channels, respectively, and the cells in the upper channels were stimulated with 0.6 dyn s cm-2 of shear stress. While the fluid stimuli after 24 h did not affect cell adhesion, the flow stimuli facilitated the expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) intermediate filaments in cells after 24 h, indicating strengthening of the barrier function.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in particular, experience influential microenvironmental conditions, which induce specific metabolic profiles that affect processes such as cell differentiation and dysregulation of the immunomodulatory funtion. Reports focusing specifically on the metabolic status of MSCs under the effect of pathophysiological stimuli - in terms of flow velocities, shear stresses or oxygen tension {\textendash} do not model heterogenous gradients, highlighting the need of more advanced models reproducing the metabolic niche.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that by producing oxalic acid, Aspergillus niger can manipulate pH during lung infection and thus, interfering with this process could limit pathogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured A. niger with oxalotrophic bacteria in increasingly complex testing systems (Petri dishes and 3D-cell cultures systems).

There is no effective strategy to intervene with TAA progression due to an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis. Insufficiency of NOTCH1 expression is highly related to BAV-TAA, but the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified.Methods A comparative proteomics analysis was used to explore the biological differences between non-diseased and BAV-TAA aortic tissues. A microfluidics-based aorta-on-a-chip model was constructed to evaluate the effect of NOTCH1 deficiency on contractile phenotype and mitochondrial dynamics of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs).Results Protein analyses of human aortic tissues showed the insufficient expression of NOTCH1 and impaired mitochondrial dynamics in BAV-TAA. HAoSMCs with NOTCH1-knockdown exhibited reduced contractile phenotype and were accompanied by attenuated mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, we identified that mitochondrial fusion activators (leflunomide and teriflunomide) or mitochondrial fission inhibitor (Mdivi-1) partially rescued the disorders of mitochondrial dynamics in HAoSMCs derived from BAV-TAA patients.Conclusions The aorta-on-a-chip model simulates the human pathophysiological parameters of aorta biomechanics and provides a platform for molecular mechanism studies of aortic disease and related drug screening.

Intraperitoneal metastases are highly associated with ascites, the pathologic accumulation of peritoneal fluid due to impaired drainage, increased peritoneal permeability, and tumor and stromal cytokine secretion. However, the relationship between ascites, vascular and mesothelial permeability, and ovarian cancer intraperitoneal metastases remains poorly understood. In this study, a vascularized in vitro model of the human peritoneal omentum and ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME) was employed to study stromal cell effects on tumor cell (TC) attachment and growth, as well as TC effects on vascular and mesothelial permeability in models of both early- and late-stage metastases. Control over the number of TCs seeded in the vascularized peritoneum revealed a critical cell density requirement for tumor growth, which was further enhanced by stromal adipocytes and endothelial cells found in the peritoneal omentum. This tumor growth resulted in both a physically-mediated decrease and cytokine-mediated increase in microvascular permeability, emphasizing the important and potentially opposing roles of tumor cells in ascites formation. This system provides a robust platform to elucidate TC-stromal cell interactions during intraperitoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer and presents the first in vitro vascularized model of the human peritoneum and ovarian cancer TME.","omentum onchip: a multicellular, vascularized microfluidic model of the human peritoneum for the study of ovarian cancer metastases.",na; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,omentum,OK,

Glioblastoma stem-likecells (GSCs) can migrate in vascular niches within or away from the tumour mass, increasing tumour resistance to treatments and contributing to relapses. To study individual GSC migration and their interactions with the perivasculature of the tumour microenvironment, there is a need to develop a human organotypicin vitromodel. Herein, we demonstrated a perivascularniche-on-a-chip, in a serum-free condition with gravity-driven flow, that supported the stemness of patient-derived GSCs and foetal neural stem cells grown in a three-dimensional environment (3D). Endothelial cells from three organ origins, (i) human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), (ii) human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and, (iii) human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) formed rounded microvessels within the extracellular-matrix integrated microfluidic chip. By optimising cell extraction protocols, systematic studies were performed to evaluate the effects of serum-free media, 3D cell cultures, and the application of gravity-driven flow on the characteristics of endothelial cells and their co-culture with GSCs. Our results showed the maintenance of adherent and tight junction markers of hCMEC/D3 in the serum-free culture and that gravity-driven flow was essential to support adequate viability of both the microvessel and the GSCs in co-culture (>80% viability at day 3). Endpoint biological assays showed upregulation of neovascularization-related genes (e.g., angiopoietins, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors) in endothelial cells co-cultured with GSCs in contrast to the neural stem cell reference that showed insignificant changes.

Precisely how these phenomena are linked, however, remains unclear. Using a cortico-hippocampal network-on-a-chip, we find that the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (DXM) stimulates the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) to phosphorylate huntingtin (HTT) at serines 1181 and 1201 (S1181/1201), which retards BDNF vesicular transport in cortical axons. Parallel studies in mice show that CORT induces phosphorylation of these same residues, reduces BDNF levels, and suppresses neurogenesis. The adverse effects of CORT are reduced in mice bearing an unphosphorylatable mutant HTT (Hdh(S1181A/S1201A)). The protective effect of unphosphorylatable HTT, however, disappears if neurogenesis is blocked. The CDK5-HTT pathway, which regulates BDNF transport in the cortico-hippocampal network, thus provides a missing link between elevated CORT levels and suppressed neurogenesis.",NA,"na;  using a cortico-hippocampal network onchip, we find that the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (dxm) stimulates the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) to phosphorylate huntingtin (htt) at serines 1181 and 1201 (s1181/1201), which retards bdnf vesicular transport in cortical axons.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",hippocampus,OK,

However, the current in vitro cell culture settings for corneal epithelial cells lack the dynamic flow conditions to recapitulate the shear stress of eye blinking, hindering corneal function evaluation. We developed a microfluidic platform enabling the dynamic culture of the human corneal barrier with recapitulation of eye blinking. The device consisted of upper and lower channels separated by a porous membrane. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T) were seeded on the porous membrane (upper channel) and cultured for ten days. The cells formed a barrier with high expression of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) tight junction protein on day seven, and the translocation of fluorescein sodium across the barrier in the microfluidic device was comparable to that in the transwell system, used as a control. Then, bidirectional and unidirectional flows were applied in the upper and lower channels, respectively, and the cells in the upper channels were stimulated with 0.6 dyn s cm-2 shear stress. After 24 h, while the fluid stimuli did not affect cell adhesion, they facilitated the expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) intermediate filaments in cells, indicating the strengthening of the barrier function. Furthermore, morphological single-cell analysis revealed an increase in the cell body area rather than nuclei.

Despite recent introduction of therapeutic agents such as anti-TNFalpha, even the best current therapies fail to achieve disease remission in most arthritis patients. Therefore, research into the mechanisms governing the destructive inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis is of great importance and may reveal novel strategies for the therapeutic interventions. To gain deeper insight into its pathogensis, we have developed for the first time a three-dimensional synovium-on-a-chip system in order to monitor the onset and progression of inflammatory synovial tissue responses. In our study, patient-derived primary synovial organoids are cultivated on a single chip platform containing embedded organic-photodetector arrays for over a week in the absence and presence of tumor-necrosis-factor. Using a label-free and non-invasive optical light-scatter biosensing strategy inflammation-induced 3D tissue-level architectural changes were already detected after two days.

This unique filtering capacity is largely due to blood microcirculation through filtration beds of the splenic red pulp in an open-slow microcirculation compartment where the hematocrit increases, facilitating the recognition and destruction of unhealthy red blood cells by specialized macrophages. Moreover, in sinusal spleens such as those of humans, blood in the open-slow microcirculation compartment has a unidirectional passage through interendothelial slits before reaching the venous system. This further physical constraint represents a second stringent test for erythrocytes ensuring elimination of those cells lacking deformability. With the aim of replicating the filtering function of the spleen on a chip, we have designed a novel microengineered device mimicking the hydrodynamic forces and the physical properties of the splenon, the minimal functional unit of the red pulp able to maintain filtering functions.

Reductionist approaches into the mechanisms that underlie such diseases have been hindered by the absence of adequate in vitro models using human cells to provide the 3D dynamic architecture that enables expression of the in vivo phenotype of the oBRB. Conventional in vitro cell models are based on 2D monolayer cellular cultures, unable to properly recapitulate the complexity of living systems. The main drawbacks of conventional oBRB models also emerge from the cell sourcing, the lack of an appropriate Bruch's membrane analogue, and the lack of choroidal microvasculature with flow. In the last years, the advent of organ-on-a-chip, bioengineering, and stem cell technologies is providing more advanced 3D models with flow, multicellularity, and external control over microenvironmental properties. By incorporating additional biological complexity, organ-on-a-chip devices can mirror physiologically relevant properties of the native tissue while offering additional set ups to model and study disease.

One important group of endocrine diseases is diabetes, which is caused by a deficiency or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin. By using a microfluidic perfused 3D cell-culture chip, we developed an 'endocrine system on chip' to potentially be able to screen drugs for the treatment of diabetes by measuring insulin release over time. Insulin-secreting -cells are located in the pancreas, while L-cells, located in the small intestines, stimulate insulin secretion. Thus, we constructed a co-culture of intestinal-pancreatic cells to measure the effect of glucose on the production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the L-cell line (GLUTag) and insulin from the pancreatic -cell line (INS-1). After three days of culture, both cell lines formed aggregates, exhibited 3D cell morphology, and showed good viability (>95%). We separately measured the dynamic profile of GLP-1 and insulin release at glucose concentrations of 0.5 and 20 mM, as well as the combined effect of GLP-1 on insulin production at these glucose concentrations. In response to glucose stimuli, GLUTag and INS-1 cells produced higher amounts of GLP-1 and insulin, respectively, compared to a static 2D cell culture. INS-1 combined with GLUTag cells exhibited an even higher insulin production in response to glucose stimulation. At higher glucose concentrations, the diabetes model on chip showed faster saturation of the insulin level.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in particular, experience influential microenvironmental conditions, which induce specific metabolic profiles that affect processes of cell differentiation and dysregulation of the immunomodulatory function. Reports focusing specifically on the metabolic status of MSCs under the effect of pathophysiological stimuli - in terms of flow velocities, shear stresses or oxygen tension - do not model heterogeneous gradients, highlighting the need for more advanced models reproducing the metabolic niche. Organ-on-a-chip technology offers the most advanced tools for stem cell niche modelling thus allowing for controlled dynamic culture conditions while profiling tuneable oxygen tension gradients. However, current systems for live cell detection of metabolic activity inside microfluidic devices require the integration of microsensors.

Understanding the necessary requirements for successful MCC is imperative to establish the pathology of disease, as well as to develop therapeutic strategies. Although postural, that is, gravitational, drainage is used clinically to aid mucus clearance, it is ignored in both animal and cell culture models of MCC. In this study, we develop a novel mucus clearance assay that enables the first particle image velocimetry of human bronchial epithelial cell cultures tilted relative to the gravitational field. This tilting system makes it possible to observe drainage of the airway surface liquid and, thus, reveals the effect gravity has on mucociliary clearance.

Human adipose stem cells (hASCs) seeded within the magnetically aligned gels were observed to align in parallel to MNP and collagen orientation 7 days post-application of the magnetic field. hASCs seeded in isotropic gels were randomly organized. Tenocyte-likeness of the cells 7 days post-seeding in collagen I scaffolds was confirmed by the positive expression of tenomodulin and scleraxis proteins. To summarize, we have developed a convenient, non-invasive protocol to control the collagen I hydrogel architecture. Through the presence or absence of MNP dosing and a magnetic field, collagen can be remotely aligned or randomly organized, respectively, in situ. Tendon-like cells were observed to organize in parallel to unidirectionally aligned collagen fibers and polydirectionally in non-aligned collagen constructs. In this way, we were able to engineer the constructs emulating a physiologically and pathologically relevant tendon niche. This can be considered as an innovative approach particularly useful in tissue engineering or organ-on-a-chip applications for remotely controlling collagen matrix organization to recapitulate the native tendon.",NA,na;  this can be considered as an innovative approach particularly useful in tissue engineering or organ onchip applications for remotely controlling collagen matrix organization to recapitulate the native tendon.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,tendon,OK,

Conventional in vitro cultures and animal models have been helpful, but suffer from limited predictive power for the human response. Advanced models are therefore required to mimic the complex biological interactions within the human joint. However, the intricate structure of the joint microenvironment and the complex nature of joint diseases have challenged the development of in vitro models that can faithfully mimic the in vivo physiological and pathological environments.

Therefore, a microfluidic chip is developed with an integrated fibrous polycaprolactone matrix in which neo-bone and cartilage are produced, that could serve as a tailored human in vitro disease model of the osteochondral unit of joints. The model enables to evaluate OA-related environmental perturbations to (individual) tissue units by controlling environmental cues, for example by adding biochemical agents. After establishing the co-culture in the system, a layer of cartilaginous matrix is deposited in the chondrogenic compartment, while a bone-like matrix is deposited between the fibers, indicated by both histology and gene expression levels of collagen type 2 and osteopontin, respectively. As proof-of-principle, the bone and cartilaginous tissue are exposed to active thyroid hormone, creating an OA disease model. This results in increased expression levels of hypertrophy markers integrin-binding sialoprotein and alkaline phosphatase in both cartilage and bone, as expected. Altogether, this model could contribute to enhanced translation from OA risk genes towards novel OA therapies.  2022 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to validate the parathyroid portion of the MPS. We prospectively collected parathyroid tissue from 46 patients with hyperparathyroidism for growth into pseudoglands. We evaluated pseudogland architecture and calcium responsiveness. Following 2 weeks in culture, dispersed cells successfully coalesced into pseudoglands 500-700 m in diameter that mimicked the appearance of normal parathyroid glands. Functionally, they also appeared similar to intact parathyroids in terms of organization and calcium-sensing receptor expression. Immunohistochemical staining for calcium-sensing receptor revealed 240-450/cell units of mean fluorescence intensity within the pseudoglands. Finally, the pseudoglands showed varying levels of calcium responsiveness, indicated by changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. In summary, we successfully piloted the development of a novel MPS for studying the effects of hyperparathyroidism on human organ systems.

The splenic RBC retention and elimination occur predominantly in open circulation where RBCs flow through macrophages and inter-endothelial slits (IESs). The mechanisms underlying and interconnecting these processes significantly impact clinical outcomes. In sickle cell disease (SCD), blockage of intrasplenic sickled RBCs is observed in infants splenectomized due to acute splenic sequestration crisis (ASSC). This life-threatening RBC pooling and organ swelling event is plausibly triggered or enhanced by intra-tissular hypoxia. We present an oxygen-mediated spleen-on-a-chip platform for in vitro investigations of the homeostatic balance in the spleen. To demonstrate and validate the benefits of this general microfluidic platform, we focus on SCD and study the effects of hypoxia on splenic RBC retention and elimination. We observe that RBC retention by IESs and RBC-macrophage adhesion are faster in blood samples from SCD patients than those from healthy subjects. This difference is markedly exacerbated under hypoxia. Moreover, the sickled RBCs under hypoxia show distinctly different phagocytosis processes from those non-sickled RBCs under hypoxia or normoxia. We find that reoxygenation significantly alleviates RBC retention at IESs, and leads to rapid unsickling and fragmentation of the ingested sickled RBCs inside macrophages. These results provide unique mechanistic insights into how the spleen maintains its homeostatic balance between splenic RBC retention and elimination, and shed light on how disruptions in this balance could lead to anemia, splenomegaly, and ASSC in SCD and possible clinical manifestations in other hematologic diseases.",NA,acute splenic sequestration crisis and erythrophagocytosis and hypoxia and organ onchip and splenic retention;  we present an oxygen-mediated spleen onchip platform for in vitro investigations of the homeostatic balance in the spleen.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,spleen,OK,

Interstitial flow of GCF strongly impacts the host-microbiome interactions and tissue responses. However, currently available in vitro preclinical models largely disregard the dynamic nature of gingival crevicular microenvironment, thus limiting the progress in the development of periodontal therapeutics. Here, a proof-of-principle gingival crevice-on-chip microfluidic platform to culture gingival connective tissue equivalent (CTE) under dynamic interstitial fluid flow mimicking the GCF is described. On-chip co-culture using oral symbiont (Streptococcus oralis) shows the potential to recapitulate microbial colonization, formation of biofilm-like structures at the tissue-microbiome interface, long-term co-culture, and bacterial clearance secondary to simulated GCF (s-GCF) flow. Further, on-chip exposure of the gingival CTEs to the toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) agonist or periodontal pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates the potential to mimic early gingival inflammation. In contrast to direct exposure, the induction of s-GCF flow toward the bacterial front attenuates the secretion of inflammatory mediators demonstrating the protective effect of GCF flow.

In 2012, the concept of the glymphatic system, a perivascular network that fluidically connects the cerebrospinal fluid to the lymphatic vessels within the meninges via the interstitium, emerged. Although its exact mode of action has not yet been fully characterized, the key underlying processes that govern solute transport and waste clearance have been identified. This review briefly describes the perivascular glial-dependent clearance system and elucidates its fundamental role in neurodegenerative diseases. The current knowledge of the glymphatic system is based almost exclusively on animal-based measurements, but these face certain limitations inherent to in vivo experiments.

To address this untreated epidemic, further investigation is needed into the leading cause of back pain, intervertebral disc degeneration.

Analysis by mRNA-seq showed that CH-Microcryogels promoted chondrogenic differentiation and inhibited inflammation, while OS-Microcryogels facilitated osteogenic differentiation and suppressed the immune response, by regulating specific signaling pathways. Finally, the in vivo engraftment of pre-differentiated customized microcryogels into canine osteochondral defects resulted in the spontaneous assembly of an osteochondral unit, inducing simultaneous regeneration of both articular cartilage and subchondral bone.

However, because of a paucity of GEJ-specific disease models, cancer-promoting consequences of TP53 and CDKN2A inactivation at the GEJ have not been characterized. Here, we report the development of a wild-type primary human GEJ organoid model and a CRISPR-edited transformed GEJ organoid model. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated TP53 and CDKN2A knockout (TP53/CDKN2A(KO)) in GEJ organoids induced morphologic dysplasia and proneoplastic features in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Lipidomic profiling identified several platelet-activating factors (PTAFs) among the most up-regulated lipids in CRISPR-edited organoids. PTAF/PTAF receptor (PTAFR) abrogation by siRNA knockdown or a pharmacologic inhibitor (WEB2086) reduced proliferation and other proneoplastic features of TP53/CDKN2A(KO) GEJ organoids in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. In addition, murine xenografts of Eso26, an established human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, were suppressed by WEB2086. Mechanistically, TP53/CDKN2A dual inactivation disrupted both the transcriptome and the DNA methylome, likely mediated by key transcription factors, particularly forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). FOXM1 activated PTAFR transcription by binding to the PTAFR promoter, further amplifying the PTAF-PTAFR pathway.

Due to few patients and experimental models, there have not been enough studies to demonstrate the pathogenesis of the disease and novel effective treatment for cMM. Since cMM resembles human MM (hMM) in histopathological characteristics, it is also considered a promising research model of hMM. Compared with conventional 2-dimensional (2D) culture methods, 3-dimensional (3D) organoid culture can recapitulate the properties of original tumor tissues. However, cMM organoids have never been developed. In the present study, we for the first time generated cMM organoids using the pleural effusion samples. Organoids from individual MM dogs were successfully generated. They exhibited the characteristics of MM and expressed mesothelial cell markers, such as WT-1 and mesothelin. The sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs was different in each strain of cMM organoids. RNA sequencing analysis showed cell adhesion molecule pathways were specifically upregulated in cMM organoids compared with their corresponding 2D cultured cells. Among these genes, the expression level of E-cadherin was drastically higher in the organoids than that in the 2D cells. In conclusion, our established cMM organoids might become a new experimental tool to provide new insights into canine and human MM therapy.",establishment of an experimental model of canine malignant mesothelioma organoid culture using a three-dimensional culture method.,"cell adhesion and dogs and emt and organoid and pleural mesothelioma and rna-seq;  compared with conventional 2-dimensional (2d) culture methods, 3-dimensional (3d organoid culture can recapitulate the properties of original tumor tissues.;  however, cmm organoid have never been developed.;  in the present study, we for the first time generated cmm organoid using the pleural effusion samples.;  organoid from individual mm dogs were successfully generated.;  the sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs was different in each strain of cmm organoid.;  rna sequencing analysis showed cell adhesion molecule pathways were specifically upregulated in cmm organoid compared with their corresponding 2d cultured cells.;  among these genes, the expression level of e-cadherin was drastically higher in the organoid than that in the 2d cells.;  in conclusion, our established cmm organoid might become a new experimental tool to provide new insights into canine and human mm therapy.; ; ; ; ; ",pleura,OK,

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 3D-spheroid culture of iHMGEC can facilitate meibocyte differentiation and induce the expression of acyl-CoA wax-alcohol acyltransferase 2 (AWAT2), shown to be required for synthesis of meibum wax esters. METHODS: iHMGEC were suspended in matrigel/basement membrane matrix and grown in proliferation media to form distinct cell clusters or spheroids. Cells were then treated with serum-free, differentiation media (advanced DMEM/F12) with and without FGF10 and synthetic agonists for the nuclear lipid receptor, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPAR). Cells were then evaluated for differentiation markers using western blotting, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and real-time PCR. Control cells were grown in standard 2D culture systems. RESULTS: Under proliferative conditions, 3D culture induced the formation of KRT5+ spheroids that contained a Ki67+/P63+ undifferentiated, basal cell population. When spheroids were switched to differentiation media containing PPAR agonists, two different organoid populations were detected, a KRT6(low) population that was AWAT2+/PPAR+ and a KRT6(high) population that was AWAT2-/PPAR-, suggesting that iHMGEC exhibit a dual differentiation potential toward either a ductal or meibocyte organoid phenotype. CONCLUSION: The 3D culturing of iHMGEC can induce the formation of both meibocyte and ductal organoids and may thus serve as a better in vitro model system for studying the regulatory mechanisms controlling meibomian gland function.","induction of meibocyte differentiation by three-dimensional, matrigel culture of immortalized human meibomian gland epithelial cells to form acinar organoid.","awat2 and acinar organoid and meibocytes and meibomian gland dysfunction and meibum and ppar- and three dimensional culture system and two dimensional culture system and dry eye;  when spheroids were switched to differentiation media containing ppar agonists, two different organoid populations were detected, a krt6(low) population that was awat2+/ppar+ and a krt6(high) population that was awat2-/ppar-, suggesting that ihmgec exhibit a dual differentiation potential toward either a ductal or meibocyte organoid phenotype.;  conclusion: the 3d culturing of ihmgec can induce the formation of both meibocyte and ductal organoid and may thus serve as a better in vitro model system for studying the regulatory mechanisms controlling meibomian gland function.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",meibomian gland,OK,

It is unclear whether neural stem cells exist in the hypothalamus. Studies have reported that adult rodent tanycytes around the third ventricle function as hypothalamic neural stem cell-like cells. However, it is currently impossible to collect periventricular cells from humans. We attempted to generate hypothalamic neural stem cell-like cells from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We focused on retina and anterior neural fold homeobox (RAX) because its expression is gradually restricted to tanycytes during the late embryonic stage.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major virulent factor of gram-negative bacteria and contributor to endodontic infections. We have developed 3-dimensional scaffold-free DPSC tissues that self-organize into dentin-pulp organoids comprising a mineralized dentin-like tissue on the periphery and an unmineralized pulp-like core. In this study, scaffold-free DPSC constructs were used as controllable experimental models to study the DPSC response to bacterial challenge. METHODS: Scaffold-free constructs were engineered using DPSCs isolated from human third molars. To simulate bacterial exposure, DPSC constructs were exposed to either Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived LPS or Escherichia coli-derived LPS. The effects of LPS on DPSC differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis were evaluated. RESULTS: Engineered tissues lacking LPS treatment self-organized into dentin-pulp organoids. LPS treatment did not negatively affect DPSC proliferation or apoptosis in the engineered tissues. Both E. coli LPS and P. gingivalis LPS inhibited the up-regulation of RUNX2 messenger RNA expression and reduced the expression of the odontoblast-associated proteins (P < .05), suggesting that LPS is inhibiting odontoblastic differentiation. However, only E. coli LPS treatment significantly reduced mineral deposition in the DPSC (P < .05) constructs, indicating that E. coli LPS but not P. gingivalis LPS reduced functional differentiation of DPSCs and prevented DPSCs from self-organizing into a dentin-pulp complex-like structure. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes scaffold-free DPSC constructs as models of oral disease. Furthermore, it emphasizes the diversity of LPS derived from different bacterial species and highlights the necessity of using LPS derived from clinically relevant bacteria in basic science investigations.",NA,odontoblast differentiation and organoid and pulpitis model and regeneration and stem cells;  we have developed 3-dimensional scaffold-free dpsc tissues that self-organize into dentin-pulp organoid comprising a mineralized dentin-like tissue on the periphery and an unmineralized pulp-like core.;  results: engineered tissues lacking lps treatment self-organized into dentin-pulp organoid.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,dental pulp,OK,

Studies in mouse in vivo models indicate that accumulation of mutant AVP prehormone is associated with FNDI pathology. However, studying human FNDI pathology in vivo is technically challenging. Therefore, an in vitro human model needs to be developed. When exogenous signals are minimized in the early phase of differentiation in vitro, mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)/induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiate into AVP neurons, whereas human ESCs/iPSCs die. Human ESCs/iPSCs are generally more similar to mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) compared to mouse ESCs. In this study, we converted human FNDI-specific iPSCs by the naive conversion kit. Although the conversion was partial, we found improved cell survival under minimal exogenous signals and differentiation into rostral hypothalamic organoids. Overall, this method provides a simple and straightforward differentiation direction, which may improve the efficiency of hypothalamic differentiation.",NA,"na;  although the conversion was partial, we found improved cell survival under minimal exogenous signals and differentiation into rostral hypothalamic organoid.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ",hypothalamus,OK,

The aim of the present study was to develop a 3D organotypic model of the pleural mesothelium. Specimens of human pleura parietalis were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany. 3D co-culture model of pleura was established from human pleural mesothelial cells and fibroblasts. The model was compared to human pleura tissue by phase-contrast and light microscopy, immunochemistry and -fluorescence as well as solute permeation test. Histological assessment of the 3D co-culture model displayed the presence of both cell types mimicking the morphology of the human pleura. Vimentin and Cytokeratin, PHD1 showed a similar expression pattern in pleural biopsies and 3D model. Expression of Ki-67 indicates the presence of proliferating cells. Tight junctional marker ZO-1 was found localized at contact zones between mesothelial cells. Each of these markers were expressed in both the 3D co-culture model and human biopsies. Permeability of 3D organotypic co-culture model of pleura was found to be higher for 70 kDa-Dextran and no significant difference was seen in the permeability for small dextran (4 kDa).

These cells transiently express smooth muscle actin (Acta2) and are enriched with platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) expression. Genetic deletion of Ctnnb1 (gene coding for beta catenin) or Fgf10 in these cells using the Acta2-Cre-ERT2 driver line after injury (defined as NA-Tam condition; Tam refers to tamoxifen) led to impaired repair of the airway epithelium. In this study, we demonstrate that RSMCs are mostly captured using the Acta2-Cre-ERT2 driver when labeling occurs after (NA-Tam condition) rather than before injury (Tam-NA condition), and that their expansion occurs mostly between days 3 and 7 following NA treatment. Previous studies have shown that lineage-traced peribronchial GLI1+cells are transiently amplified after NA injury. Here, we report that Gli1 expression is enriched in RSMCs. Using lineage tracing with Gli1(Cre-ERT2) mice combined with genetic inactivation of Fgf10, we show that GLI1+cells with Fgf10 deletion fail to amplify around the injured airways, thus resulting in impaired airway epithelial repair. Interestingly, Fgf10 expression is not upregulated in GLI1+cells following NA treatment, suggesting that epithelial repair is mostly due to the increased number of Fgf10-expressing GLI1+cells. Co-culture of SCGB1A1+cells with GLI1+cells isolated from non-injured or injured lungs showed that GLI1+cells from these two conditions are similarly capable of supporting bronchiolar organoid (or bronchiolosphere) formation. Single-cell RNA sequencing on sorted lineage-labeled cells showed that the RSMC signature resembles that of alveolar fibroblasts. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for the involvement of mesenchymal progenitors in airway epithelial regeneration and highlights the critical role played by Fgf10-expressing GLI1+cells in this context.",NA,na;  co-culture of scgb1a1+cells with gli1+cells isolated from noninjured or injured lungs showed that gli1+cells from these two conditions are similarly capable of supporting bronchiolar organoid (or bronchiolosphere) formation.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,bronchiole,OK,

Mutations in a relatively small set of genes account for 75% of bilateral anophthalmia cases, yet 25% of families currently are left without a molecular diagnosis. Here, we report our experimental work that aimed to uncover the developmental and genetic basis of the anophthalmia characterising the X-linked Ie (eye-ear reduction) X-ray-induced allele in mouse that was first identified in 1947. Histological analysis of the embryonic phenotype showed failure of normal eye development after the optic vesicle stage with particularly severe malformation of the ventral retina. Linkage analysis mapped this mutation to a ~6 Mb region on the X chromosome. Short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of affected and unaffected male littermates confirmed the Ie linkage but identified no plausible causative variants or structural rearrangements. These analyses did reduce the critical candidate interval and revealed evidence of multiple variants within the ancestral DNA, although none were found that altered coding sequences or that were unique to Ie. To investigate early embryonic events at a genetic level, we then generated mouse ES cells derived from male Ie embryos and wild type littermates. RNA-seq and accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) data generated from cultured optic vesicle organoids did not reveal any large differences in gene expression or accessibility of putative cis-regulatory elements between Ie and wild type. However, an unbiased TF-footprinting analysis of accessible chromatin regions did provide evidence of a genome-wide reduction in binding of transcription factors associated with ventral eye development in Ie, and evidence of an increase in binding of the Zic-family of transcription factors, including Zic3, which is located within the Ie-refined critical interval. We conclude that the refined Ie critical region at chrX: 56,145,000-58,385,000 contains multiple genetic variants that may be linked to altered cis regulation but does not contain a convincing causative mutation. Changes in the binding of key transcription factors to chromatin causing altered gene expression during development, possibly through a subtle mis-regulation of Zic3, presents a plausible cause for the anophthalmia phenotype observed in Ie, but further work is required to determine the precise causative allele and its genetic mechanism.",NA,na;  rna-seq and accessible chromatin sequencing (atac-seq) data generated from cultured opticvesicle organoid did not reveal any large differences in gene expression or accessibility of putative cis-regulatory elements between ie and wild type.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,optic vesicle,OK,

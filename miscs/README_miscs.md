## organ_classification_final.xlsx

Showing the hierarchical classification used in the analysis.

1. The leftmost column shows the highest level categories (i.e., 1st-level categories), largely corresponding to the organ system. This level of categories are often referred to as "major_organ" types in the R scripts.
2. Remaining columns contain organ types belonging to the higher level categories shown in columns immediately to the left.
3. In short, one may find an organ name, and then navigate to the left (and then up if the left cell is empty), and will find the higher level category that the organ belongs to.
